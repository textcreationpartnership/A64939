            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Review and Examination of a Book; bearing the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the <hi>Hiſtory of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>AMongſt the many ſad tokens, and prodigious Prognoſticks of Gods anger againſt the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> our multiplied Diviſions are none of the leaſt. The righteous and holy God being deeply provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, hath armed every man againſt his brother, ſo that <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> is againſt <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> and they both together againſt <hi>Judah.</hi> And the Lord hath hereby, in the open view of the Atheiſtical and prophane world, pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed contempt upon the remnant of his people, that deſire to cleave to his way and truth, and made them deſpicable, as a broken veſſel that cannot be made whole again. And this is the more afflicting, that theſe contentions abound in a time, wherein the Proteſtant Religion is viſibly in ſo great danger from Popery and Popiſh Plots. It therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns all them, who are any thing affected with the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40126:3"/> wrath and anger of a jealous and provoked God, to lye in the duſt, to ſearch out their own ſins and provocations, and ſincerely bewail them before the Lord. And although the publick defections and provocations, ought not to be ſlighted, but much ſorrowed for; yet it is to be feared, that perſonal humiliation, repentance, and reformation, hath been little minded by many pretending to the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of publick ſins. O that every one of us might find grace, ſeriouſly to enquire what we have done, and that (at ſuch a time, when all ſouls ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exerciſe of Religion is like to evaniſh into noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and debates) every one of us would lay to heart the evil of his way, both as to acceſſion unto publick provocations, and as to perſonal ſins. It is now high time, when the Lord is ſo viſibly taking vengeance for our inventions.</p>
            <p>It hath been the ſad obſervation of divers, that every new tryal hath been the occaſion of a new difference, if not diviſion. The Lord partly, in his holy diſpleaſure, withdrawing light, and chaſtiſing his people for their ſins, and partly trying, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing of them in that great duty of mutual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, ſo little made conſcience of; and partly diſcovering infirmities, much droſs in his own, by the conteſts ſo carnally managed. This we are now to inſtance in the Indulgence, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was firſt looked on as a favour and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from God, and the Miniſters that imbraced it were adviſed thereto by the generality of outed Miniſters (a great part whereof were then at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denborough</hi>); yet now the contention about it is come to ſuch a height, that the acceptance is cried
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40126:3"/> down, as highly ſinful, and the hearing of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſters Preached and written againſt, as utterly unlawful: The Indulged Miniſters have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally hitherto (for ought I know), with much Chriſtian meekneſs and patience, endured re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, finding that what Letters were ſpread abroad againſt them, did contain nothing but high Magiſterial dictates, without any ſhew of arguments; as alſo, they were reſolved by their ſilence and forbearance, to evidence their great deſire to prevent contentions: but now, leſt their ſilence ſhould be looked on as faintneſs, ariſing from the conviction of the evil of their Cauſe (which, it ſeems, made the Author of one of theſe Letters to write, that they never had the heart to dare to ſpeak or themſelves), I ſhall ſay ſomething in their behalf. I muſt confeſs, I am aſtoniſhed to read theſe Papers that are going up and down amongſt the people, wherein with high and bitter words (which I love not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat), the Indulged Miniſters are repreſented, as having acknowledged, and homologate a formal Eccleſiaſtick Supremacy, aſſumed by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and having ſubjected their Miniſtry in a direct line of ſubordination unto his cognizance (as inferiour Civil Courts are unto the ſuperiour); yea not only ſo, but theſe grave and worthy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, who thought it their duty to notice, and bring to an account ſome few Probationers, that were viſibly ſowing ſedition, and kindling a flame, are repreſented as enamoured with that Idol of Jealouſie (meaning the Indulgence), and as acted by the ſpirit of Antichriſt. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40126:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> Becauſe they took upon them to queſtion the carriage of a few hardy and extravagant young men, the tendency of whoſe way, will ere long make it to appear, what a ſpirit they were acted by. But before I go further, I muſt here proteſt, that the perſonal reproaches caſt upon thoſe honeſt Miniſters, are not ſo much the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive that prevails with me to put Pen to Paper, upon this Subject, as reſpect unto the Truth, and publick Intereſt of the Church (the unity and order whereof ſeems to be wholly ſhaken, and going to ruine, by the courſes driven on by ſome), and to the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, who, I am ſure, have been armed by God in the Miniſtry, with a bleſſing upon the ſouls of many; though it is like theſe that now ſeek to decry the Indulged Miniſters, will not believe that ever their Miniſtry was bleſſed and countenanced of God; and how can they, ſeeing they look not upon them as the Ambaſſadors of Chriſt? But bleſſed be God, who hath looked upon them as his Ambaſſadors, and hath not left their Miniſtry without the ſeal of a ſenſible bleſſing upon many.</p>
            <p>But that I may inform honeſt well-meaning people, who are jumbled and confounded with queſtions about the acceptance of the Indulgence, and about hearing of Indulged Miniſters, I ſhall endeavour to lay the matter open in a plain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; The perſons conferring, ſhall be a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter</hi> not Indulged, but clear for hearing Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſters: an ingenious <hi>Farmer,</hi> who ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to hear Indulged Miniſters, and a <hi>Preacher,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:40126:4"/> who is againſt the hearing of Indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Farmer.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, it is now near Sun-ſetting, I would be much obliged to you, if you would be pleaſed to lodg at my houſe this night.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Miniſter.</speaker>
               <p>I would be nearer the Church, ere I take up my lodging; for I uſe to make my Sabbath-days journeys as ſhort as I can.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Farm.</speaker>
               <p>You will be nighted ere you can come where you can have any tollerable lodging, and you may with eaſe reach the Church to morrow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sermon-time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>Well, I am content to ſtay with you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Farm.</speaker>
               <p>I aſſure you of welcom. When you have taken ſome refreſhment, I ſhall within a little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe you when to come to the Family-exerciſe; and after Supper I ſhall deſire half an hours confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence about a particular, with which I will not now trouble you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>I uſe to be heavy after Supper, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take a little time juſt now, or, if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be fit for a Sabbath-days diſcourſe, we may confer upon it to morrow in our way to the Church.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Farm.</speaker>
               <p>It is almoſt all the matter of ſome folks diſcourſe upon the Sabbath; but for my ſelf, though I am ſometimes a hearer of ſuch diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes upon the Sabbath, I have no great pleaſure in them, for I find not my ſelf edified by them, as I was wont to be with the diſcourſes which we uſed long ſince to have upon the Lords day. As for going to the Church with you to morrow, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you would excuſe me in that matter, for I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40126:5"/> have not clearneſs to hear Indulged Miniſters; but you ſhall not want company, for there are ſeveral of my Family, who have clearneſs to hear, and I dare not hinder them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>I commend you, in that you do not impoſe your opinion in that matter upon others: but did you not once hear Indulged Miniſters?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Farm.</speaker>
               <p>I did; but I have more light about the Indulgence than I had; and I am much confirmed in withdrawing from hearing, by a <hi>Preacher</hi> who is in the next Chamber; and, if you will, I ſhall call him to the conference about the Indulgence; for this is the conference which I deſigned to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you with after Supper.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>I think it very fit that you call him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Preacher.</speaker>
               <p>I have over-heard you, and half an invitation is enough to ingage me in that confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which ye deſign; but I deſire, Sir, that you and our Landlord may enter upon it, and I ſhall ſpeak when I think it convenient.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>Seeing you did once hear the Indulged Miniſter, who is ſetled in this Pariſh, why did you withdraw from hearing him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Farm.</speaker>
               <p>It is very confidently ſaid, by thoſe who are acknowledged for able men, and very zealous, that the Indulged are not the Miniſters of Chriſt, but of men.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>It is as confidently ſaid, by as able and zealous men, That the Indulged Miniſters are the Miniſters of Chriſt, and not the Miniſters of men. But our faith and practice muſt not be ruled by mens ſayings, how confident ſoever the ſayers be: Ye know the Reformed Churches have, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40126:5"/> rejected that error of the Popiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, that people ſhould implicitely, that is, in effect blindly believe all that they ſay, and do all that they direct.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

Thoſe Miniſters were ſo far from renouncing their dependance on Chriſt, and their Miſſion from him, that they at the firſt acceptance of the Indulgence, declared
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40126:6"/> to the Council, that they were the Miniſters of Chriſt, that they had received their Miniſtry from Chriſt; and they were ſo far from ſubjecting their Miniſtry, and the matters of their Miniſtry, to the Magiſtrates pleaſure, that they declared, that they were the ſervants of Chriſt in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that they would behave, as became the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt; and they were ſo far from receiving the Magiſtrates inſtructions, that they declared they could not receive from the Magiſtrate inſtructions intrinſecally Eccleſiaſtical, to regulate them in the exerciſe of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; and the Author of the Hiſtory of the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence grants, that Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> did give a faithful teſtimony againſt theſe inſtructions, and that Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon</hi> ſaid the ſame upon the matter with Mr. <hi>Blair;</hi> and as theſe Miniſters did by word, in the preſence of the Council, ſhew that they could not accept of ſuch inſtructions of their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips making, and impoſing, and did deſign them impoſitions; ſo their practice did evidence, that they did not accept of theſe inſtructions; and any who will but read Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s ſpeech at the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, in which he aſſerts, That as they had received their Miniſtry from Chriſt, and full pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions to regulate them in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry, ſo they were to diſcharge it, as they would be accountable to Chriſt; will wonder how any perſon, let be a Miniſter, who had read that ſpeech, could harbour any ſuch ugly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious thoughts of theſe Miniſters, and much more that any could deliberately write and Print ſuch horrid falſhoods and reproaches of honeſt Miniſters.</p>

               <p>They have their Miniſterial calling, or which is all one, Authority, to exerciſe the acts of their Miniſterial Office, from Jeſus Chriſt, as the fountain of their ſpiritual power; and this Miniſterial Authority flowing from God, was conveyed to them by the Presbyteries, by which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40126:7" rendition="simple:additions"/> they were ordained Miniſters according to Chriſt inſtitution. But they have the peaceable publick exerciſe of their Miniſtry, in theſe places, by the Magiſtrate, under God. It's the Magiſtrates civil Authority, by which the penal Statutes, which rendered their Preaching hazardous, are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or relaxed; by the protection of Civil Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, they have the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry, or they have freedom from moleſtation or diſturbance, while they are exerciſing their Miniſtry in theſe places. Before the Act of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence they had their Miniſterial Authority, and did Preach upon hazard before they were Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; but by the Indulgence they had this benefit, that whereas before it, they were expoſed to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard wherever they Preached, whether in private or publick; after it, they might Preach publickly, and exerciſe the other parts of the Miniſterial Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, in ſome places, without moleſtation.</p>

               <p>Sir, I beſeech you make uſe of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther word than that long word, with the four <hi>O</hi>'s in it; for though I have often heard it, I ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly profeſs I do not underſtand it. I always thought, that many of our Country people ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered themſelves ridiculous, by learning to ſpeak words, like Parrots, which they did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>That's not the worſt of it; for when poor people are once brought to ſpeak confidently
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40126:8"/> they wot not what, they may be brought next to do they know not what; and to ſtumble they know not at what: As it was indiſcreetly done to bring in this long Greek word among unlearned people, ſo this word is miſerably miſapplyed in the buſineſs of the Indulgence; for to homologate, is to ſay what was before ſaid, in the ſame or like words; as when in a Court one declares his mind in ſome matter, and another riſes up after him, and ſays the ſame which he ſaid, in the ſame, or like words; this laſt ſpeaker is ſaid to homologate what the other ſaid before him. Now the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſters, when they accepted the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, were far from ſaying that the Magiſtrate had a Spiritual Supremacy, or an abſolute Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy; they never ſaid it, they never thought it; they declare, that the Magiſtrate hath not the power of the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven at all, and much leſs a Supremacy of Spiritual power; and they declare, that the Magiſtrate may not do what he pleaſes in Eccleſiaſtical matters; for all things in the Church of God muſt be done accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the will of the God of Heaven, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of man; they were ſo far from ſaying any thing for the Magiſtrates Spiritual or abſolute Supremacy, or any thing that ſounded that way, that they ſaid much to the contrary, as appears in their ſpeeches before the Council; and as they ſaid nothing ſounding this way, ſo they did nothing in accepting the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry, which did any way import any approbation of any unlawful Supremacy; they grant, that the King is Supreme Civil Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40126:8"/> of his Kingdoms; and that it belongs to the Magiſtrate, as Magiſtrate, to take off civil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints, which hinder Miniſters from the peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exerciſe of their Miniſtry; and that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ſhould permit and allow Miniſters to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their Miniſterial Office in his Dominions; and when the Magiſtrate did this in the Indulgence, he did not exerciſe any unlawful Supremacy, but did exerciſe that lawful Authority which he hath from God, for good; and when they made uſe of the liberty granted by the exerciſe of lawful Authority, they did not approve of any ſinful Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, but did approve, and make uſe of that lawful power which the Magiſtrate hath from God. All Orthodox Divines grant, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate not only may, but ſhould permit, allow, countenance, and protect the exerciſe of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Goſpel in his Dominions; and when there is need, the Magiſtrate may command and compel Miniſters to do the work of their Office, as appears from the Books of Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi>

               <p>We ſhould be feared for ſin, and for that ſin, among the reſt, of adding to the word of God; they who make theſe actions, which are not tranſgreſſions of the Law, to be ſins, do high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoke God; but they who make theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which God not only permits, but alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and commends, to be ſins, they ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Throne of God, and annul his Law,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40126:9"/> and countermand the commands of the moſt high God: Sin, ye know, is the tranſgreſſion of the Law of God; before ye believe that the hearing Miniſters of the Goſpel Preach the Goſpel, is ſin, ye ſhould require, that they who ſay ſo much, ſhew you what command of God is tranſgreſſed by your hearing Indulged Miniſters; for if ye be ſo eaſily driven from the worſhip of God by ſtrong alledgments, the Devil can alledg as ſtrongly, and ſuggeſt it importunately, that it is a ſin to pray in your Family, in which it may be there are ſome profane perſons; and if ye be driven from Family-worſhip by ſuch alledgances, he will alledg, that it is a ſin for you to believe on the Name of the Lord Jeſus; and thus drill you from all exerciſes of Religion, publick, private, and ſecret.</p>

               <p>But Sir, ſeeing I doubt if it be lawful to hear, I would be damned if I did hear; for ye know the Apoſtole ſays, <hi>he that doubteth is damned, if he eat.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>But if you take up doubtings, whether ye ſhould do what God hath commanded, and that upon meer alledgances that theſe duties are ſin, you lay your ſelf open to the tentations of Satan, who by this method will drive you from all duty, and by your doubtings make void the law of God; for he will ſtrongly alledg, that it's a ſin to pray to God; and if ye upon this doubt, if ye ſhould pray, and then upon your doubting forbear praying, what comes of the command, That men muſt always pray, and not faint? There is a great difference betwixt praying, hearing the word of God, and the eating of meats, which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40126:9"/> the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in that fourteenth Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> for it was once un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to eat of thoſe meats which was diſcharged in the Ceremonial Law, and it was not neceſſary by any precept to eat of thoſe meats; ſo that the weak Chriſtian who did not yet underſtand that the Ceremonial Law was abrogate, was under no obligation to eat of thoſe meats; it was lawful to thoſe who knew their Chriſtian liberty to eat (providing they did not uſe their liberty unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably before weak ones, and ſo induce them to do what they judged unlawful) and it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to them to forbear; the uſe of theſe things being at that time, as Mr. <hi>Rutherfurd</hi> ſhews in his Treatiſe of Scandal, every way indifferent.</p>
               <p>The doubting of theſe weak ones, did ariſe from the Ceremonial Law, which was unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionably the Law of God; and there was no Law obliging them to eat of theſe meats at that time; and ſo their doubting in ſuch a caſe at that time, was a doubt very incident to thoſe who did know the Law, and were tender of it; and their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that that Ceremonial Law was the Law of God, and their fear to break the Law of God, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned their doubting; and there was no hazard of ſin in forbearing to eat, but there was ſin in eating, ſo long as their doubt remained; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord would not have the ſtrong eating before theſe weak ones, to wound their weak Conſciences.</p>
               <p>Hence it appears, that they who would from this place plead for their forbearing to pray or to hear the word of God, becauſe, forſooth, they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40126:10"/> doubt if they ſhould pray or hear Gods word; they fearfully miſapply and wreſt that Scripture; for this doubt is no ways like the Jews doubt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about eating of ſuch or ſuch meats; for the Lord had once forbidden to eat of theſe meats, but he never forbad the hearing of his own Word, he never forbad prayer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There was no command obliging theſe weak <hi>Jews</hi> to eat of theſe forbidden meats at that time; but there is a command obliging us to hear the Word of God, and not to forſake the aſſembling of our ſelves together, not to deſpiſe prophecying, and obliging us to pray without ceaſing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe doubtings of the weak <hi>Jews</hi> was not damnable; for they did not incur the hazard of damnation by their doubting, but by their eating with a doubting Conſcience. But the doubting of theſe, who doubt if they ſhould hear the Word of God, and if they ſhould joyn with the Church of God in hearing the Word of God, in praying and praiſing, their doubting is damnable, and they ſhould repel it with deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and abhorrency, and not ſo much as liſten to ſuch a ſuggeſtion of the Devil, who goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to make void the Law of God, by raiſing ſuch prophane and godleſs doubtings in mens minds, that he may drive them from all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exerciſes, to groſs profanity: And if people would obſerve what abſurdities this doubting to hear Indulged Miniſters, has produced, it might, through the bleſſing of God, be a means to clear them of theſe doubtings. I doubt not, but
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40126:10"/> ye have heard of ſome, who from doubting to hear Indulged Miniſters, have proceeded to doubt if they ſhould hear any Miniſters who were for hearing Indulged Miniſters; and ſome have gone that length, that they would hear none but thoſe who were not only againſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Indulged Miniſters, but alſo Preached againſt the hearing of them; and ſome have doubted themſelves out of all hearing; and ſome are come to that, that they will not joyn in private prayer with thoſe who hear Indulged Miniſters. It's true wiſdom and tenderneſs to repel doubts and ſcruples, which hinder us from the worſhip of God, or move us in it, that they may not get any entrance into our minds and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and if they have entered, we ſhould caſt them out with deteſtation.</p>

               <p>Some of them are in the Pariſhes where they were ordained Miniſters by the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery. Others of them, who had no acceſs to the Congregations where they were ordained, were cordially invited by vacant deſtitute Congregations; and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters concerned, approved of the peoples invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of the Miniſters going to theſe Pariſhes upon the peoples invitation. And what more could be expected in a broken time, when Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40126:11"/> Government was broken, and General Aſſembles, Synods, Presbyteries, diſſolved, and Presbyterian Miniſters turned out of their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and diſperſed and ſcattered through the Nation? If theſe Congregations caſt at theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Miniſters, and diſown them as not their Miniſters, and ſo think themſelves looſed of all obligation to hear them, they ſhake themſelves looſe of any obligation to hear any Miniſters; for no other Miniſters can pretend ſuch intereſt in theſe Congregations as they really have, upon the grounds which I mentioned. If you be not obliged to hear the Indulged Miniſter, who is in your Pariſh, becauſe he is not your Miniſter, then upon the ſame ground ye are not obliged to hear any outed Miniſters, who occaſionally come alongs to Preach; for they are not Miniſters of this Congregation: And if ye be obliged to hear them, though they be not Miniſters of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, why are ye not alſo obliged to hear the Indulged Miniſters, though they were not Miniſters of theſe Congregations? They who ſhake themſelves looſe of any relation to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Miniſters, will very eaſily ſhake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves looſe of any obligation to hear others. And this is the thing which the Devil deſigns, to caſt the people looſe of all relation to Miniſters, and of all obligation to hear any, whether Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or no Indulged. And he hath gained this deſign, as to ſome, who are come to that, that they think not themſelves obliged to hear any, except it be one or two whom they think the only witneſſes; and others think themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40126:11"/> not to hear theſe, and think it much better to hear none, than to hear theſe, who teach ſuch ſtrange, and wild conceits, which tend to the confuſion both of the Church and Kingdom; and many finding, that all obligation to hear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Miniſters, is called in queſtion, and that the hearing of Miniſters depends upon their own pleaſure, they are better pleaſed to ſtay at home on the Sabbath, than to go any where, to hear any Miniſter; and this is like to prevail with people who have not any true principle of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; for this is an eaſie way, and pleaſing to fleſh and blood.</p>

               <p>The Indulged Miniſters, do not bring forward the whole Reformation with them; they have no Presbyteries, Synods, General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; they have quit theſe: Our godly Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors would have taken nothing, except they had gotten all, they would not have quit with a hoof; and ſeeing it is ſo, how ſhould we own them, or hear them, who are ſo far degenerate from the zeal of the Miniſters of Chriſt who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in former times?</p>

               <p>This reaſon, if it were good, would caſt all the Miniſters who are not Indulged, as well as the Indulged; for they want Presbyteries, Synods, and General Aſſemblies; in the fields, or houſes where they Preach, they do not bring the whole frame of Presbyterian Government along with them where they come to Preach; and if you do not diſown them, becauſe they want ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſemblies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> why ſhould you diſown Indulged Miniſters upon this account? Will you

And becauſe the Lord in his righteous Judgments hath taken away theſe ſolemn Courts of his Houſe, which were great bleſſings to the Church, and hath ſcattered his Servants; will ye as far as in you lies, deprive them of the power of Preaching the Goſpel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have not acceſs to the exerciſe of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? This looks like a judicial infatuation, to caſt at any remnant of Gods Ordinances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye have not all; doth this look like humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity? or looks this like the frame of the Godly Iſraelites, who when the ſtately Temple was ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined, yet took pleaſure in the Stones of <hi>Zion,</hi> and favoured the Duſt thereof?</p>

General Aſſemblies, Synods, Presbyteries, were taken away long before the Indulgence; and therefore 'tis a fooliſh Calumny which hath no ſhadow of likelihood, that the Indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters by accepting the Indulgence, did quit theſe Courts; for they were quit and gone before the Indulgence; the Indulged Miniſters got ſomewhat of that which they formerly had, liberty to Preach without hazard in ſome places, and to keep Church-Seſſions; but they quit nothing when they accepted of that.</p>
               <p n="3">3. 'Tis a great wrong done to our Anceſtors, to alledge that they were ſuch humorous Fools, that they would take nothing from the Magiſtrate if he withheld any thing which was due to the Church: They did indeed deſire all the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es priviledges, but they took what they could get, and made the beſt uſe of it in the mean time, till more came.</p>

               <p>Although Queen <hi>Mary</hi> laboured to impoſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery upon the Nation, and was far from grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all which She ſhould have granted; yet as they, who were of the Reformed Religion, were far from ſcrupling to ſeek and petition for liberty to their Miniſters to Preach the Goſpel; ſo when theſe Petitions, or any part thereof, was granted, they thankfully accepted of what was granted. And although King <hi>James</hi> and his Heirs and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors have a vaſt Supremacy ſetled upon them, <hi>Anno</hi> 1584. <hi>Parl.</hi> 8. <hi>James</hi> 6. And though he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted that Supremacy; yet the Miniſters, though they found themſelves deprived of their priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which they judged due to the Church, and though ſeveral of them were impriſoned, baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their adhering to theſe priviledges; yet they were always willing to take the liberty of Preaching the Goſpel when the King granted it; and when they could not get acceſs to their own Charges, they did take other Charges. Mr. <hi>Bruce</hi> did not return to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> his proper Charge, but to <hi>Larber:</hi> When Mr. <hi>Scrimgeour,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Kinghorn,</hi> was outed, he was ſo glad when he heard that an honeſt Miniſter would be permitted to go to his Charge, that he ſaid, O to have it but one day old, I would with joy bear him on my back, to have the Goſpel preached to my poor people. Mr. <hi>Welch,</hi> a man of God, when he was impriſoned in the Caſtle of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> for holding the Aſſembly at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> he was ſo far from refuſing to take liberty to Preach from the King, till he repented and reſtored the Churches priviledges, and till the Church got all that was
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40126:13"/> due; that he deſires the Lord <hi>Ochletree</hi> to carry a Petition from him to his Majeſty, intreating for liberty to Preach the Goſpel: And thus he owned a lawful Civil Supremacy in the King, and ſued for its lawful exerciſe, in granting the liberty to Preach the Goſpel, even when he was ſuffering upon the account of his diſowning the Kings ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual or vaſt Supremacy.

                  <hi>WE Miniſters of Chriſt, reſident within the Cities</hi> of London <hi>and</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>and lines of Communication, having ſeen and read an Order of the Honourable Houſe of Commons Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in Parliament, bearing date,</hi> June 9. 1646. <hi>requiring, and enjoyning all the Miniſters of the Province of</hi> London, <hi>forthwith to put in Execution the Ordinances concerning Church-Government, we thought it requiſite humbly and faithfully, as in the ſight of God, to ſhew our judgments and reſolutions about this weighty matter, for clearing of our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40126:14"/> and preſerving our Conſciences void of offence both towards God and man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We have ſecondly, pondered the ſtate of things, and find our ſelves, whether we act as is required, or act not, in a very great ſtrait: On the one ſide, Prelacy being juſtly pulled down, and the Church miſerably groaning under diſcord and confuſion, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things cry aloud upon us, in our places, to put Church-Government into actual Execution; the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, the edification of his Church, the duty of our Functions, the engagement of our ſolemn Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, the command of the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, which ſo far as we can with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, we are reſolved, and hold it our duty to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, and the preſent unſpeakable miſeries of the Church, by woful Diviſions, Blaſphemies, Hereſies, abominable Lazineſs, Libertiniſm, Atheiſm, the ſpiritual ruines of many Congregations through falſe Teachers, for want of faithful Paſtors, for lack of Ordination. On the other hand, upon conſideration of all the Ordinances of Parliament about Church-Government, we find many neceſſary things, not yet eſtabliſhed, and ſome things wherein our Conſciences are not fully ſatisfied; and therefore in our begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to act, we cannot but ſee how ſiniſterly we are like to be interpreted by many, who are prone to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtruct all our actions of this nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We hereupon hold it neceſſary, to expreſs upon what grounds we may proceed to act upon the Ordinances already eſtabliſhed by Authority, although that we conceive the power of Church-Cenſures, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the Lords Supper, to be in the Church Officers, by the will and appointment of Jeſus Chriſt, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40126:15"/> from him they receive their Office and Authority; yet we acknowledg, it belongs to the Magiſtrate to have his Conſcience ſatisfied in the truth of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church which he will ſet up by his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, from whom the Church-Officers do receive Authority of the publick exerciſe of their Offices, in his Dominions; and in caſe the Magiſtrate be not fully informed, as to ſet up a right and perfect rule in every particular, the Church-Officers may act un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that rule, provided they do not ſubſcribe to, nor otherwiſe acknowledg that rule to be intire, and right in all points; and therefore for theſe particular Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, although we humbly conceive they do not hold forth a compleat rule, nor are in all points ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory to our Conſciences, yet becauſe we find ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things eſtabliſhed in them, agreeable to the word of God, for which we deſire heartily to bleſs God, and to be thankful to the Honourable Houſe, proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being made for enabling of the Elderſhips, by their Authority to keep away from the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per all ignorant perſons, and many ſcandalous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, with a Declaration of their reſolution, that all notorious and ſcandalous perſons ſhall be keeped from the Sacrament, and that there ſhall be an addition to the ſcandalous offences formerly enumerated. We conceive it is our duty to begin to act, in reference to Church-Government, by Congregational, Claſſical, Provincial, and National Aſſemblies; reſolving by the grace of God, to walk in all things according to the Word, and according to the Ordinances, ſo far as we conceive them correſpondent to it, and to be countable to the Magiſtrate whereſoever he ſhall call us thereto; hoping ſo to carry our ſelves, as not
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40126:15"/> only to enjoy his concurrence with us on all occaſions; but alſo that he will ſupply what is lacking, to make the Government entire, and likewiſe to make altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in all things that ſhall happen to be amiſs. In this doing we truſt we ſhall not grieve the Spirits of the truly godly either at home or abroad, nor give any juſt occaſion to them who are contrary-minded to blame our Proceedings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which Paper we may ſee, how reſpectfully and courteouſly theſe worthy and godly men walked towards the Magiſtrate, how much they give him as his due, even when he was exerciſing Eraſtianiſm in a great height, giving Rules and Directions to regulate them in admiſſion to the Lords Supper, limiting them as to ſcandal, with divers other things, which they here but general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hint; and yet having given this ſober ſalvo for quieting their Conſciences, and guarding againſt offences; they do not refuſe to go the length they have acceſs, for doing their duty.</p>
               <p>And thus I have ſhewed you, that they are much miſtaken who imagine that our zealous Anceſtors were of that humour, that they would take nothing except they got all which they thought due, and that they would do nothing except they got leave to do all, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction put upon them by the Magiſtrate. That <hi>Calderwood</hi> in his Hiſtory, p. 381. relates: <hi>That the Synod of</hi> Fife, Anno 1597. <hi>inſtructs their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to travel with the Miniſters, Barons, and Noblemen, that a ſupplication may be given in for the Miniſters of</hi> Edenburgh, <hi>and</hi> Mr. David Black,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40126:16"/> 
                  <hi>that they may be reſtored again to their Flocks, and to behave themſelves therein in the fear of God, and love of Chriſt and his Kingdom, faithfully and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently, with all dutiful reverence to the Kings Majeſty.</hi> And p. 470. That <hi>Anno</hi> 1603. Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Bruce</hi> deſired his Majeſties warrant of his re-entry to his calling, or repoſition to his place: And in that ſame Page, in his Letter to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> he ſays: <hi>And to this effect I cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the Act of Council which ſtood againſt me, which cloſeth up my mouth, might be deleted; and that alſo I might have a warrant from his Majeſty, to teſtifie his Majeſties good will to my free and full Repoſition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That paſſage of Scripture, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.26.—<hi>Not an hoof ſhall be left behind,</hi> is frequently uſed, and very often abuſed and miſapplyed, as in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe; <hi>Moſes</hi> would not leave a hoof, and therefore Miniſters ſhould not preach the Goſpel when the Magiſtrate permits it, except he permit Presbyteries, Synods, General Aſſemblies, and reſtore Peesbyterial Government entirely as it was. But there is ſo great diſparity in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that there it no ground for the inference of the one from the other: For <hi>Moſes</hi> was made a God to <hi>Pharaoh, Exod.</hi> 7.1. He was King in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurun;</hi> as he was extraordinarily raiſed up by God, ſo he was backed by the miraculous power of God, which plagued <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the Egyptians.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in poſſeſſion of their Beaſts, and had the extraordinary warrant and protection of God to ſecure their poſſeſſions. Further, <hi>Moſes</hi> had alſo a reaſon for his refuſal to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40126:16"/> leave a beaſt; for ſays he, <hi>Thereof we muſt take to ſerve the Lord, and we know not with what we muſt ſerve the Lord until we come thither.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If <hi>Moſes</hi> had been a meer Subject of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and if <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had taken away all the Iſraelites Beaſts, and had them in his poſſeſſion; if <hi>Moſes</hi> being but a meer Subject, having no extraordinary call nor capacity, had refuſed to take any of the Beaſts again, except <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would give every hoof, there would have heen ſome kind of reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance; but as the caſe ſtands, there is none.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> would not part with what he had in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and therefore we ſhould not take a part of that which we are deprived of, except we get all. <hi>Moſes</hi> gave a reaſon why he could not leave a hoof, becauſe they were to ſacrifice, and they knew not what Sacrifices the Lord would require: But what reaſon can we give for that reſolution, that if we get not all at once which is taken away, we cannot, we will not take any thing? there is no reaſon here but will and humour, and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent pride.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> being extraordinarily authorized and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted with the miraculous power of God, would not quit the grip of what he had in poſſeſſion, and that upon a ſolid reaſon; and therefore a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who have through their ſin and the diſpleaſure of God, loſt the poſſeſſion of the Church Priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es they had, ſo that all is quit and gone, that they ſhould take nothing till they get all; that they ſhould refuſe the benefit of Preaching of the Goſpel, till all their Aſſemblies for Government be reſtored, this looks like a judicial infatuation,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40126:17"/> a proud heart in a poor breaſt, that hath mickle dolour to dry. They who are wiſe and humble, will ſee that 'tis their duty to be humbled under the ruines and deſolations of the Church, and to take back any little that may be had, till the Lord ſend better.</p>

                  <p>I ingenuouſly acknowledg, that I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and informed by what you have ſaid in ſeveral things, which I did not before underſtand: But Sir, I wonder how ye who are not indulged, labours ſo much to juſtifie the Indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, when the Indulged Miniſters, as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, confeſs that they are wrong; and if what they have done were to do, they would not do it.</p>

                  <p>That is among the falſe reproaches that are caſt upon the Indulged Miniſters; they grant that there are ſeveral things in the Magiſtrates actings, which relate to the Indulgence, which are not right; as the Act of Inſtructions; but for that Act, which is indeed the Act of Indulgence, the permitting and allowing the Preaching of the Goſpel, they declare upon all occaſions, that the Magiſtrate not only may, but ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and allow the Miniſters of the Goſpel to Preach the Goſpel; and as for their own practice in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the liberty of the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry, when the Magiſtrate granted it, they have upon all occaſions declared, that it was their duty to do what they did, and that they could not have had peace in their Conſciences to have refuſed to Preach the Goſpel in theſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40126:17"/> places, where they are ſetled, and ſeveral of them have declared this, when they ſaw themſelves near to Death and Judgment, as for example, Mr. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander Blare,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Alexander Wedderburne.</hi>

The time was, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who had muttered ſuch odious Calumnies of honeſt Miniſters, would have been hunted and hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at, as graceleſs Perſons; but now its a great part of ſome peoples work, to make up, and take up falſe Reproaches of Miniſters: it's a great Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the abſence of the God of Truth, that the Spirit of Truth, and the Spirit of Love, is far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from many of this Generation; and that a lying Spirit, the Devil, the Calumniator, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer of the Brethren, doth much prevail in the hearts of many, who are under the power of this luſt of evil ſpeaking; But I think it very obſervable, that the Lord hath ſo overruled the Devil and his Inſtruments, that the lies which they have ſpread, are ſo manifeſtly falſe, and ſo void of any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Truth, that none but theſe who deſire to believe lies of the indulged Miniſters, will be deceived by them; and ſober Perſons are the more reſpectful to the Indulged Miniſters, becauſe they ſee the Devil, the Father of lies, is ſo buſie in feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40126:18"/> falſe Accuſations againſt them. They ſay, if there were not receivers, there would not be thieves; if there were not ſo many to liſten to ſuch Backbiters, and to take up ſuch reproaches which others have made up, this Trade of Calumniating would decay. I hope, Landlord, you will think it your Duty after this, to diſcountenance, and drive away ſuch Tale-bearers and Back-biters, by an angry Countenance, and ſharp Rebukes, that they may not go on to delude themſelves, in thinking the more ill tales they have of the Lords Servants, that they are the more Religious; but they may be brought to underſtand, that they are Satans In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and doing his Work. As you would abide in the Tabernacle of God, and dwell in his holy Hill, beware of Back-biting, beware of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up a Reproach againſt your Neighbour: Ye muſt not only forbear to make up, but ye muſt not take up, or as ſome read it, ye muſt not receive nor endure a Reproach againſt your neighbour.</p>

                  <p>I thank you for your good Counſel, or rather for minding me of the Counſel of God in the 15 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and I ſhall by the grace of God reſiſt that luſt of evil-ſpeaking for the time to come. I hear much, that the Magiſtrate had an ill deſign in granting the Indulgence, and therefore the Miniſters ſhould not have accepted of it, and we ſhould not hear them; for their Preaching, and our hearing, furthers that ill deſign.</p>

                  <p>I think we might be better imployed, than in gueſſing at Stateſmens deſigns. I have been cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly informed, that they who were the firſt movers of the Indulgence, had a very good deſign, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40126:18"/> none who knew them, will ſuſpect them of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous deſigns; others I ſuppoſe, who were not much taken up with ſupernatural ends, or deſigns, yet they deſigned the Quiet and Peace of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; they deſired not inteſtine Wars; they were content that they that would not hear Conformiſts, might be rid of Trouble and Fining; if any intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Indulgence for diviſion, they who divide upon that head, they work to their hand; but its an idle fancy to imagine, that the ill deſign of the Magiſtrate, who permits the preaching of the Goſpel, will alter the Nature of the Goſpel, or make the good deſign of the Goſpel of no effect, or that it will vitiate the preaching or hearing of the Goſpel to thoſe who preach and hear the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in that manner, and for that end, that the Lord hath appointed it to be preached and heard. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a Magiſtrate did for ſome ill end, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a faithful, skilful Phyſician to exerciſe his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the Magiſtrates ill deſign would not alter the nature, or hinder the Operation of the Phyſick given by that Phyſician, who did not approve of that ill deſign, but honeſtly deſigned the health of his Patients, and uſed the proper means for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing or recovering their health. And it's ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſonleſs conceit to imagine, that when a Magiſtrate aſſumes to himſelf ſome falſe Title, or unlawful power, that in that caſe no uſe may be made of that lawful Authority which he hath as Magiſtrate. Though <hi>Cyrus</hi> prefixed a great lie to his Proclamation which granted the <hi>Jews</hi> liberty to return and build the Temple of the Lord; yet the <hi>Jews</hi> were not ſuch fools, as not to make uſe of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40126:19" rendition="simple:additions"/> the good Decree, becauſe the King ſaid, that God had given him all the Kingdoms of the earth, and ſo arrogated to himſelf more power than God had given him.

                  <p>Sir, you have much obliged me, by ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with me this night, and it will be a double obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, if you come again to my houſe upon <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> and bring that Anſwer with you. But it is now time to go to the Family-exerciſe. I ſhall deſire of you both, that ye would be pleaſed to forbear to fall upon this queſtion about the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40126:19" rendition="simple:additions"/> before my Family. Let the ſubject of your diſcourſe at Table, and after Supper, be of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes which may be fitter to prepare us for ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Lords day, than this doubtful diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. I hear alſo from ſome of my Neighbours, that ſince their ſervants did withdraw from hearing Indulged Miniſters, and from the duty of Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing, they are become more ignorant and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of learning the grounds of Religion, and are taken up with the jangling about the Indulgence, as if that were the one thing needful, not to go to the Kirk, but to the fields, to hear Preaching. And I hear th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ir Maſters complaining, that they are become more unruly, and make leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of doing their work, which makes me ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, that all is not right in this new way they have taken; and to be ingenuous with you, I find, that my own withdrawing hath not been to my advantage; and this prejudice againſt the Indulged Miniſters, who Preach edifying Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, ſeems not to be to edification; I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hear no Preaching upon the Sabbath, when there is no Preaching in the Fields, in the bounds; and I ſometimes upon falſe Advertiſements wander, ſeeking Preaching in the Field, and find it not; and ſometimes there comes Preachers along, whoſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is little to Edification, which makes me often think, that thoſe of my Family who go to the Kirk, and brings away edifying Notes of the Sermon, ſpend the Sabbath much better than I do; and when I compare their Notes with the Notes of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who go to the Field, who either bring away nothing, except it be a fair general, that the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40126:20"/> had brave work, and it was a wonderful Sermon, or ſome reflection upon the indulged Miniſters, or ſome bitter invective againſt the Magiſtrate. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but think, that they who go to the Church have the advantage of theſe who go to the Fields. And therefore I do not deſire, that theſe of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily who go to the Church, may be hindred from going; for I am edified by the Notes which they bring from the Church.</p>

               </sp>
               <p>There are ſo many Papers already extant, and never yet anſwered, which from the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and from the Writings of Orthodox Divines, do clearly demonſtrate the lawfulneſs of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of the peaceable Exerciſe of the Miniſtry, granted in the Magiſtrates Acts of Indulgence, that it may ſeem a needleſs work to write any more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Subject. And if the ſad Conſequences which have followed upon this Queſtion, did not render it ſerious, it were almoſt ridiculous to move
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40126:20"/> the Queſtion whether theſe of the outed Miniſters of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who after the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grates Act of Indulgence, did either reſume to their own Congregations, or not having acceſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their own Congregations, did upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation of vacant Congregations, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Miniſters concerned, come to help theſe deſolate Congregations, till they might have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to theſe Congregations where they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſetled. Whether theſe Miniſters did right or not; and whether theſe Congregations did right in receiving, and countenancing their own Miniſters, or in inviting and countenancing thoſe Miniſters who had no acceſs to their own Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, but had acceſs to the peaceable Exerciſe of their Miniſtry among them? They who will make a queſtion, if it be lawful for Miniſters of the Goſpel to preach the Goſpel to their own Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, or when they have not acceſs to their own Congregations, if it be lawful to preach to deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Congregations, which earneſtly deſire them to come and help them; they may make a queſtion of any thing. And yet ſome have not only ſtarted this queſtion, but reſolved it in the Negative; and not only ſo, but they have raiſed a horrible Hue-and-Cry after theſe honeſt Miniſters, for going to preach the Goſpel in theſe Congregations, as if they had been Thieves or Robbers, and have charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them as Traitors, Betrayers of the cauſe, and what not? and have not only ſtirred up the People to diſown and deſert them, but have commended their deſerting of them, as a neceſſary teſtimony, forſooth, againſt Eraſtianiſm: and thus one of the vileſt and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40126:21"/> moſt groundleſs Schiſms that hath ever been in the Church, is made a ſort of Martyrdom.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine was firſt whiſpered to the People in private Conferences; then it was dropped now and then in the Sermons of one or two; then ſome raſh youths made it a great part of their diſcourſe in publick; then we had Letters and Queſtions from <hi>Holland,</hi> with Advertiſement, that the Preſs was travelling with the Hiſtory of the Indulgence, which is now brought forth. And although any thing to the purpoſe in it, hath either been anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or grounds laid down from which it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, in the Anſwers which were given to the Authors Letters and Queſtions: yet becauſe ſome have alledged, that this Book is ſo irrafragible in its reaſon, that the many who are againſt it, ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to anſwer its Reaſon, and a friend of this Hiſtorian threatned, that he would make all the Indulged Miniſters run before him; and becauſe the People who withdraw from the Indulged Miniſters, are confident that this Book will never be anſwered, and ſo are hardened in their Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and becauſe there are many dangerous and deſtructive Tenets in this Book, and the Epiſtle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to it, which if reduced to practice, would fill the World with Confuſion; I ſhall for Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Truth, and out of Love and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to the People, who are deceived by this Book, and for the juſt Vindication of the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Indulged Miniſtes, who are very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly reproached in this Hiſtory, examine all that looks like reaſon in this Book. And though
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40126:21"/> I be of their Opinion, that all that hath any ſhadow of Reaſon in this Book, might be anſwered fully in a few Pages; yet ſeeing many are ſo poſſeſſed with a conceit of the Unanſwerableneſs of this Book, that if any part of it were left unanſwered, it would be alledged that it could not be anſwered, and this might be a ſnare to the poor people, who lay ſo great ſtreſs upon this Book; I hope the judicious Reader will forgive me, that I put my ſelf to ſo much labour, which to him ſeemeth needleſs; for though it will not only ſeem, but be really need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to the Judicious Reader, yet it is neceſſary for the weak, for whoſe ſake I eſpecially put my ſelf to this trouble.</p>
               <p>The Hiſtorian gives his Book the Title of <hi>The Hiſtory of the Indulgence,</hi> ſhewing its <hi>Riſe, Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Acceptance together with a Demonſtration of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawfulneſs thereof.</hi> If under the name of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence he comprehend all the Acts of the Magiſtrate, which he records in this Hiſtory, he abuſes the word Indulgence, and he abuſes his Reader; for there are ſeveral of the Acts which he relates, as for Example the Act of Inſtructions, and the Act of Fining the Miniſters who kept not the Twenty ninth of <hi>May,</hi> which were not Acts of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. The Acts of Indulgence were only thoſe Acts which granted the peaceable Exerciſe of the Miniſtry to ſome Presbyterian Miniſters, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Laws which eſtabliſhed Prelacy, and enjoyned Conformity, But this Confuſion runs through his whole Book, in which he would have his Reader believe, that the Indulged Miniſters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40126:22"/> of all theſe Acts, which he calls, or rather miſcalls by the name of Indulgence; and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion is one main foundation upon which his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Babel is found. Whether he hath demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated the unlawfulneſs of the Magiſtrates Acts in which theſe Miniſters are permitted, and allowed to preach the Goſpel, or the unlawfulneſs of the acceptance of the peaceable exerciſe of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, we will ſee when we come to his Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, and his anſwers to contrary Objections.</p>
               <p>As for his Vindication of ſuch as ſcruple to hear the indulged, it is a rare undertaking, and looks liker the attempt of a Knight errant, than of a ſolid and peaceable Divine; for a ſcruple (as he might have learned from <hi>Ameſius</hi> in his Caſes of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, 1 Book, and ſixth Chapter) is a raſh and groundleſs fear, and therefore he hath been very ill adviſed to undertake to maintain thoſe who ſcruple to hear Indulged Miniſters; this was a raſh and frantick act of Caſuiſtick Chivalry; his proweſs would have been better proved and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of all ſober perſons, in ſetting theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple free from theſe raſh and groundleſs fears; for that would have been a right Vindication of thoſe Scrupulous people, to have delivered them from their raſh and groundleſs fears, which ſcare them from their mercies, and the means of their Salvation, and was an injurious cruelty to their ſouls.</p>
               <p>The Hiſtorian deſigns himſelf a Presbyterian, in great Letters; and yet this Book is a Hiſtory of warring againſt Presbyterians; and if it were fair War, it were more tollerable; but as the War is groundleſs and unjuſt, ſo it is very foully ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40126:22" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                  <hi>non amice factum ab amico.</hi> And though he be a Presbyterian in great Letters, in <hi>uberiore forma,</hi> and the Indulged ſtand before him in the frontiſpiece of his Book, in a very ſmall Character, yet he ſhould have remembred, that he was but one, and they were many, and it is not a Presbyterian practice, but a Popiſh Prank for one to ſtigmatize, cenſure and condemn many; his Deſignation ſhould have put him in minde of Presbyterian Practice, and that among Presbyterians, matters are carried by the Plurality of voices, and not by the will of one how great ſoever he imagine himſelf to be; but there are ſo many things in this Hiſtory, which are inconſiſtent with Presbyterian Principles, and which overturns the very foundation of Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Government, and of all Government; and there is ſo much Satyrick, inſolent inſulting over his Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Brethren, that he had ſome reaſon to fear, that he would be taken for ſome other ſort of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than a Presbyterian: and therefore he hath done as the Painters they ſay were wont to do, when the Art of Painting was rude, and it was not eaſie to know where a Horſe were a Horſe or an Ox, what was defective in their Painting they helped it by writing, and in good great Letters wrote down, this is an Horſe, and this an Ox, that none might miſtake. I cannot but reſent the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which he hath done to Presbyterians, and to their cauſe, in calling himſelf a Presbyterian, and then acting the part ſometimes of a Pope, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of a Separatiſt, and venting extravagant, wild conceits, which are contrary to the received Tenets of Presbyterians; but I am hopeful that no

               <p>Before I come to the Hiſtory, I find an Epiſtle to the Chriſtian Reader written by the Hiſtorians Friend, who was like-minded with him in theſe matters relating to the Indulgence. This Epiſtle is particularly directed to the ſuffering Miniſters and Profeſſors of the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi> To theſe Chriſtian Readers, he ſays, he need not tell them, that the knowledge of the Times, and what the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael of God ought to do, ſhould be their Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Cognizance, diſtinguiſhing them from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who are brutiſh in their knowledge.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40126:23"/> it to be only wiſdom and ſagacity, either natural, or gotten by long experience, to diſcern and know the very moment of Opportunities, a thing very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, whence ordinarily depends the good ſucceſs of Affairs Others ſhew, that theſe men of <hi>Iſſachar</hi> were men eminently skilful, and endued with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to know what was to be done, and when, and gave evidence of this ſagacity at this time, in taking this fit opportunity in turning the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> and they were followed by their Brethren in this matter.</p>
               <p>This Knowledge of the Times was not common to all the Profeſſors in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> for if ſo, this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Times would not have been noted by the Spirit of God, as ſomething remarkable in theſe men of <hi>Iſſachar.</hi> And no doubt there were many <hi>Iſraelites</hi> who were taught of God, and were ſufficiently diſtinguiſhed from thoſe who were bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh in their knowledge, who yet had not this Knowledge of the Times, to know when it was time to make War, and to make alterations in the State, in turning the Kingdom from the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>David.</hi> This Knowledge of the Times is very deſirable, but every thing deſirable is not a duty. <hi>Moſes</hi> wiſhes that all the Lords People were Prophets; but it is not the duty of every one of the Lords People to be a Prophet, and to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie. Again, there are ſeveral things which we are oblidged to have and to do, which yet are not the Cognizance, or the Badges and Marks where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they who are taught of God, are diſtinguiſhed from them who are brutiſh in their Knowledge;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40126:24"/> as for example, an eminent meaſure of Knowledge, of Prudence, of Love, of Aſſurance, theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, are excellent Ornaments, but they are not Badges and Marks common to all thoſe who are taught of God, and diſtinguiſhing them from thoſe who are brutiſh in their Knowledg; for there are many honeſt Profeſſors who are taught of God, who have not attained to theſe eminent degrees of Knowledge, Prudence, Love and Aſſurance. Again, it's the duty of all Profeſſors to obey the Law of God perfectly, otherways their defects in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience would not be ſins. But that perfection is not the Badg or Cognizance to diſtinguiſh thoſe who are taught of God, from thoſe who are brutiſh in their Knowledge. So that though that knowledge of the times were a thing which all <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould be adorned with, yet it would not be right to make it their Cognizance, or a diſtinguiſhing Mark to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference them from thoſe who are brutiſh in their Knowledge.</p>
               <p>But for any thing that appears from the Text or the Interpreters, which I have conſulted this, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Times was a natural or political ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity attained by long experience, by which theſe men of <hi>Iſſachar</hi> knew what was the fit ſeaſons of making War and alterations in matters of State, which concerned all <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for this ſort of Knowledge of times, I ſuppoſe the Author of the Epiſtle will not ſay, that it is the duty of every Profeſſor in the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> to have this politick ſagacity, to diſcern
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40126:24"/> the Seaſons of making War, and making alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in State matters: and much leſs is this politick ſagacity and prudence, which is not ordinarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, even by men imployed in State-Affairs, but by much exerciſe and long experience, to be made a Cognizance diſtinguiſhing thoſe who are taught of God, from thoſe who have not ſaving knowledge: for this knowledge of the Times is (as Interpreters think) a natural or politick know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and ſo no evidence or mark of a Spiritual and ſupernatural eſtate. This is certain from the Scripture, that this Knowledge of the Times was a Knowledge which diſtinguiſhed ſome of the Tribe of <hi>Iſſachar</hi> from the Generality of the people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and therefore this Scripture is miſapplyed, when this Knowledge of the Times is alledged to be the Mark and Cognizance of all who are taught of God, diſtinguiſhing them from thoſe who have no true Wiſdom, but are brutiſh in their Knowledge, and ſo like the beaſts that periſh.</p>
               <p>This is an ill token that the Author of this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle hath ſtumbled in the threſhold, and in the very Entry of his Addreſs; and his ſtumbling is the more dangerous, becauſe it may be a ſtumbling-block to private Profeſſors, by putting this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in their heads, that they muſt either have the knowledge of the Times that the men of <hi>Iſſachar</hi> had, concerning the fit ſeaſons of making War and peace, and of making State-alterations, or elſe they are brutiſh in their Knowledge, and are not taught of God. This were the way to put all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors Male and Female, Lad and Laſſe, to become
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40126:25"/> Politicians, and to take on them to know and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould do, to determine what the State and Church ſhould do. And thus they are diverted from ſtudying to know what they ought to do themſelves, and how they ought to rule their own Families, and ſet a work to dive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the intrigues of State-policy, and to plot altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of States, and conclude when to make Wars; and to alledge that all who are taught of God, have that Knowledge of the Times which the men of <hi>Iſſachar</hi> had, is to deceive them, and make them imagine that they have that Knowledge which they have not, and to tempt them to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with things that are too high for them, and to crack their brains by racking them to reach thoſe things which are beyond their Capacity, and to ſtretch themſelves beyond their line, and paſs the bounds of their Station and Vocation. Such flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering inſinuations, which either puff up people with a conceit of their Wiſdom, to manage the greateſt and moſt important Affairs of Kirk and State, and that they are fit to guide their Guides, and break the Ice to them, as the Hiſtorian ſays in his 28 Queſtions and Vindication, hath done much harm to ſeveral well-meaning people, and put them from minding the duties of their particular Callings, and the Duties of their Chriſtian Vocation, in the exerciſe of Faith and Repentance, and in giving diligence in the exerciſe of the Graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to glorifie God, and enjoy him, and to make ſure their calling and election, and to edify one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and put them to be wholly or moſtly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up about the managing of publick Affairs, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40126:25"/> to break out of their own place, and paſs the bounds of their Vocation, that they may right all that's wrong; and what confuſion this breeds, both Reaſon and Experience may teach us. If Profeſſors had been earneſtly exhorted to do the duties of their Vocation, which the Lord calls them to, and to be earneſt in praying to God for thoſe whom God hath called to be Magiſtrates and Miniſters, that they might be guided of God, and inclined to thoſe things that are right in the ſight of God, that they might under them live a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlineſs and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty: This had been to put them to their duty, to walk in the way of God, and to have ſhunned many diſorders and confuſions, and to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Iſraels mercy, whom the Lord led like a flock by the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when every private Profeſſor is taught, that he knows the Times, and what Iſrael ought to do, and that he is fit to guide the Shepherds, and go before them, in breaking the Ice; what can be expected from ſuch Antiſcriptural Conceits, but Confuſion and Ruine? He adds, neither need I tell you how impoſſible it is to know what the preſent day and hour makes indiſpenſable duty, without a juſt reflection on what is paſt; for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergents of the preſent day can never be improved to the advantage of preventing the morrows Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, without this — Now that you and I may be helped to a profitable reflection upon what is paſt, and improve it to it's juſt Advantage, the Lord hath been pleaſed in this unconcerned Soper of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40126:26"/> many, to put it upon the heart of a Servant of his— to give you and me the following Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Doth he think that what he ſays here, is ſo evident, that every Chriſtian Reader knows it without his telling them; if he had only ſaid, that a juſt Reflection on what is paſt, is uſeful for the Time preſent; or if he had only ſaid, that this Reflection on what is paſt, is uſeful for improving the emergents of the preſent day, it might have paſſed without Animadverſion; but when he makes it impoſſible to know the preſent days du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without Reflection on yeſterday; when he ſays, that the preſent days emergents can never be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved without reflection on yeſterday; He hath needleſly, by winding up his Aſſertions as high as his fancy could twine them, crackt their credit, and diſobliged his Reader, and provoked him to ſtand out againſt his Aſſertions, as injurious, in bringing him under a new impoſſibility and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency which he knew not of. Now men love not to be brought under Impoſſibilities, of knowing and acting: for</p>
               <p n="1">1. It's neither Time paſt nor preſent, which makes duty, or makes us know what is duty; nor is it the remembrance of what is paſt, that makes men know what is their preſent duty: it's the will of God and not Time, which makes this or that our duty; and it's the Revelation of the Will of God that makes us know what's our duty the day, and what was our duty or error yeſterduy. <hi>Adam</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:40126:26"/> knew the duty of the day in which he was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, but he had no yeſterday to reflect upon. Suppoſe a man loſe all memory of what is paſt, yet he may by taking heed to his way accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the word, know his preſent duty. I have known ſome Perſons have that weakneſs of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, that they did not remember that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had ſpoken but a little before, and yet they made Conſcience of ſpeaking right when they ſpoke. It's a hard thing to bind a man who hath loſt his Memory of things paſt, up under an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of knowing his duty in things preſent.</p>
               <p>Again, he makes a juſt Reflection, not only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a mans own actions, which he may more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know, but alſo a Reflection upon the Actions of others, which he cannot know, but by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of others, and written Hiſtories, abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary for knowing the duty of the preſent day: Now this is yet a more intolerable Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, to make our neceſſary preſent duty, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon uncertain Relations, and it may be falſe ſtories; how can men be aſſured, that their reflections upon theſe paſt things are juſt, when they know not whether the things be truly and juſtly related? As for Exemple, this Hiſtory of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence hath many falſhoods in it, and theſe falſhoods are not fit to inſtruct any what is the preſent duty, but are apt to deceive the Readers, and induce them to ſin, and not direct them to their duty. But I ſee if I ſtay thus with the Author of the Epiſtle, it will be long ere I can come to the Hiſtorian; and therefore I ſhall only
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40126:27"/> take notice afterward of theſe things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Indulgence in this Epiſtle. But ere I go further, I cannot but here remember what I heard a Judicious Gentleman ſay of the Author of this Epiſtle, <hi>viz.</hi> that he uſed to get as high in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, as his fancy could reach: this is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in Romantick Writers, but it's a great fault in any who pretend to write Truth, eſpecially in Divines. And this puts me in mind of what I heard that great, judicious, and acute Divine, Mr. <hi>James Wood</hi> ſay, that the ſtudy of the flouriſhes of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, was dangerous in a Divine; becauſe as theſe flouriſhing Rhetorications do divert the Hearers or Readers from the ſimplicity of the Goſpel; ſo they who follow them, are in hazard in that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit to run over the bounds of truth, and to fly higher than Scripture and ſolid Reaſon do allow. The Author of the Epiſtle, hath frequently in theſe few lines, flown higher in his fancy, than Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or ſolid Reaſon will allow:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In making the knowledge of the Times, to know what Iſrael ought to do, the Cognizance and Badge of the Profeſſors of the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In making it impoſſible to know the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent duty, without Reflection on the Time paſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In making our neceſſary duty depend upon humane Stories, which are often falſe, and at beſt very uncertain.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:40126:27"/>4. In ſaying, that the emergents of the preſent day can never be improved, without this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on Yeſterday.</p>
               <p>Seeing the Author of the Epiſtle hath aſſaulted the Indulged Miniſters with Queſtions; I ſhall make uſe of the ſame Weapon, that he may have fair play; and my firſt Queſtion is, Whether he hath any Scripture or Reaſon to prove theſe four Aſſertions laſt mentioned? My next Queſtion is, what Warrant hath he to ſay ſo confidenly, that the Lord put it upon the Heart of the Hiſtorian to give us this Hiſtory? Does he think that the Hiſtory was inſpired by the Lord into the Heart of this Hiſtorian? In this Hiſtory there are many falſhoods in matter of Fact, many falſe Reaſonings; there are Contradictions and Inconſiſtences: Now the God of Truth puts it not upon mens hearts to write Untruth. There are many bitter Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and Calumnies, much of the Wrath of man, many things which are not for Peace and Edification; the deſign of the Book is a vile Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and Schiſm: Theſe things are not from God, who is Love, who is the God of Peace, who hath commanded us to do all our things in love, and not to forſake the aſſembling of our ſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>My third Queſtion is, How he will refute thoſe who alledge that the Writing of this Story came in the Head and Heart of the Hiſtorian, as it came in <hi>Davids</hi> head and heart to number the People? The Lord was angry againſt Iſrael, and he left
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40126:28"/> 
                  <hi>David</hi> to the temptation of Satan, and to his pride and he numbred the People, and this brought on the Plague. The Lord was angry at the People, who were weary of the Ordinances, and were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed to lightly Miniſters; and the Lord in his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous judgment, may juſtly leave men to their Pride and Self-conceit, to Write and Print Calumnies againſt Miniſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for a Plague upon thoſe who depiſe his Servants and Ordinances, ſo filling them with their own ways: this Book is a great Plague to ſuch people, hardning them in their neglect of Preaching, Catechiſing, to the increaſe of ignorance, unbelief, ungodlineſs. The diſmal effects which he ſpake of, are not the effects of the Magiſtrates granting, or the Miniſters accepting of the peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry. Pag. 3. he charges the Indulged Miniſters with a fearleſs making and medling with the ſtated enemies of Gods work, ere they had mourned over former unfaithfulneſs and miſcarriages, and ere Brethren equally concerned, were conſulted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> How knows he that they were fearleſs, or that they had not mourned for their former miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages? by what evidence doth he thus judge of the frame of the hearts of his fellow-ſervants, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when he was at ſuch a diſtance from them when they medled in this matter? and I ſuppoſe he will not conclude, that they had no fears nor tears, becauſe they did not Print them and ſend them over ſea, ſeeing they have been and are mourners, of whoſe tears the World gets not notice; and I am inclined to think, that the deepeſt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40126:28"/> ſorrow makes leaſt dinn. Every mourner hath not the opportunity of publiſhing their tears in Print; and many Mourners have put Books to the Preſs, whoſe Modeſty would not ſuffer them to mention their own Tears. As there is raſhneſs in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerning the inward frame of his Brethrens heart, in intruding into thoſe things which he hath not ſeen; ſo there is ſomething more than raſhneſs, in his alledging that Brethren were not conſulted; for he might have known, if he would have been at the pains to have enquired, that Brethren were conſulted, and that the generality of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in <hi>Scotland,</hi> were for Miniſters returning to their own charges; and that thoſe who had not acceſs to their own charges, might upon the Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of vacant Congregations, go and exerciſe their Miniſtry among them. But I perceive that he is againſt all medling with the preſent Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, becauſe of the ill they have done and do deſign. He looks on all making and medling with them, as Defection, and the cauſe of further De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; for, ſaith he, what elſe but further De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection could be expected as the iſſue and reſult of thoſe medlings? the Author of the Cup of cold Water, adviſes to ſtand aloof from all liſtnings to propoſals coming from them, or making any to them; and he conceives we are called of God to take this courſe, as that way wherein alone we can expect his approbation and countenance, Pag. 41.</p>
               <p>Again pag. 42. he ſaith, it paſſeth his ken what Addreſs can be made to him, except it be to tell, we can make none, or to beſeech him
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40126:29"/> to forbear to perſecute the Mediators Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours; and that he ſeeth not, and hopes never to ſee with his eyes; who can ſee how Addreſſes to them in Church-matters can conſiſt with the reſentment of their Uſurpation of Chriſts Throne? and after in that ſame Page, We have nothing to ſeek from any who ſets in our Maſters Chair of State; God forbid that ever we ſhould be ſeen to bow or beg to them, while they ſit there; however when we are paſſive, we may make uſe of what liberty is given, yet it's our Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to abſtain from ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and receivings from thoſe who ſtand in ſuch terms of Oppoſition to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is new Doctrine, a new light which I ſuppoſe come never to light till now; if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath learned it of any, I wiſh he would tell us who are his Authors. I doubt if he can ſhew us a Precedent going before us in this way in which, and (which is more ſtrange) in which alone we can expect Gods Approbation and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, I wonder how he hath come to have ſo great Confidence in this untrodden Path, that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are called of God to keep at ſuch a diſtance from their Rulers, as to ſtand aloof from all liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to their Propoſals; And that Subjects are called of God, to ſtand aloof from making any Propoſals to their Rulers: And that this Courſe is the way, and the only way wherein they can expect Gods Approbation and Countenance, are ſtrange and bold Aſſertions, which ſhould not have been obtruded upon us by his Conceit. A Divine call, and Divine approbation ſhould have been
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40126:29"/> confirmed by Divine Authority; what knoweth he, but the Lord may put ſome good motion in their hearts? he hath put good things in the hearts of Idolaters, Heathen Princes, to which the Lords People did liſten, and to which they were oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to liſten, and for which they found themſelves bound to bleſs the Lord, who had put ſuch things in their hearts; the Lord can put good Motions in the Hearts of ill Men, and to refuſe to liſten to thoſe Motions which are good and of God, is to refuſe to liſten unto God. How can this conſiſt with the Honour which all Inferiours, Servants, Children, Subjects, are bound to give to their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours? I ſuppoſe there is no Superiour who would not judge it to be a manifeſt Contempt in his Inferiour, if he ſhould keep at ſuch a diſtance from him, as that he would neither hear what he propoſed to him, nor yet would propoſe any thing to, nor deſire any thing of his Superiour.</p>
               <p>I cannot ſee how a man can bind himſelf to keep ſuch a diſtance from any man, Superiour, Equal or Inferiour, as not to liſten to any thing he ſays, be what it will. This ſtanding aloof from all liſtnings to any Propoſals made to us, and from making any Propoſals to them, if we like not thoſe that are made by them, ſeems inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with common Civility and humanity. This is a new ſort of an Act of Intercommuning: Let us hear his Reaſons for it, pag. 41. firſt, ſaith he, This is the moſt proper means to convince them of their Wichedneſs. I am ſo far from being of his Opinion, that I think it were a very proper Way,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40126:30"/> to provoke them to uſe all Violence againſt ſuch who would neither hear them, nor ſpeak to them; who would neither ſeek nor take any thing from them, this would appear to them a great height of Inſolence and Contempt; and Inſolence and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in Inferiours towards their Superiours, is no proper means to make Superiours better, but hath a native tendency to tempt and provoke them to be worſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he ſaith, That this is the alone expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to preſerve our ſelves free of all compliances with them, and in good terms with Jeſus Chriſt; and this, ſays he, is beſt Policy, to beware of ſinning him out of Soul or ſight, by touching with that which his Soul hates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> As we muſt not ſin againſt Chriſt by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with Rulers in any thing that is ſinful; ſo we muſt not ſin againſt him, by deſpiſing Dignities, and by carrying our ſelves inſolently towards thoſe whom he hath commanded us to honour: but we ſhould both honour them, and forbear to comply with them in any evil. We ſhould not refuſe to hear their Propoſals, if they make any to us, but we ſhould hear them, and if they be good, entertain them; and if they be evil, we ſhould with meekneſs of Wiſdom ſhew the evil of them, and give our Reaſons why we cannot comply with them. Thus we both keep our ſelves free from the ſin of contempt of lawful Authority, and from the Contagion of any ſinful Propoſal; and what know we, but ſolid Reaſons given to the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40126:30"/> Magiſtrate, may inſtruct and edifie him, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him from preſſing that which is not right.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſaith he, this is the way to preſerve Unity among the Remnant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is none of the means of Unity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the Scripture; and if it be not among the means of Union which God hath appointed, I know not what ground we have to expect that it will be effectual for that Union which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be among his People.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This was not the way that our godly and learned Anceſtors took: new ways are ordinarily dividing ways. This way would quite caſt out the Magiſtrates and the Nonconformiſts; and this is the thing which the Papiſts have been driving this long time; and it would certainly break the Nonconformiſts: for if this Motion ſhould take with ſome, it would not take with Judicious and Sober Perſons, for they would perceive that this were the High-way to render the whole Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts hateful to Magiſtrates, as a pack of ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, humorous People, who would neither ſeek, nor take any thing from them, nor hear them, nor anſwer any thing to them, except it were, that they would neither make nor meddle with them, and that they would make no Addreſs to them; except it were to tell them that they could make none to them. Yet I perceive, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, pag. 42. though he is for abſtaining from ſeeking and receiving any thing from them, yet
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40126:31"/> he thinks we may make uſe of what liberty is given by them. When I read this, it put me in mind of ſome petted Children, and of ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons under deep Melancholly, who will not ſeek meat nor receive it from thoſe who would give it to them; yet if it be ſet down beſide them, they will eat it: it's hard enough to make any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable rational difference betwixt receiving liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and making uſe of liberty given. And I can ſee no reaſon why we may not receive and ſeek that which we may take and make uſe of when it is given; there is more Humor than Reaſon in this diſtinction. Yea, I perceive that the Author is not againſt all ſeeking; for in that ſame page he allows of one Petition to be put up to them, and that is to beſeech them to forbear to perſecute the Mediators Embaſſadors; if we may beſeech them to forbear one evil, why may we not beſeech them to forbear other evils? and if we may beſeech them to forbear to do evil, why may we not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech them to do good? The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> when he is ſpeaking to a very wicked Generation, whom he calls Rulers of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and People of <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> he puts theſe together, <hi>Ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In that ſame page the Author limits this keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aloof as to Addreſſes to the Magiſtrate, to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes in Church-matters: he hath foreſeen the Objection which would be made; if we may make no Addreſſes to them, then how ſhall Wrongs be righted, Juſtice adminiſtred? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For it is not to be ſuppoſed that Rulers will right thoſe who are wronged, except the Wrong be repreſented to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40126:31"/> them, and recourſe be had to them for Redreſs. But if we may make Addreſſes to them for right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wrongs done to us in our Perſons, or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, why may we not make Addreſſes to them for righting the Wrongs, that are done to Chriſt and his Church? If Eraſtian Supremacy doth not bar us from making Addreſs to them, from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and medling with them in ſeeking what is due to us from them, and receiving it when they give it; why ſhould it hinder us to make and med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with them, in ſeeking that they would do right to the Church and Servants of Chriſt? and when they do any thing right in taking off any undue Reſtraints which they had laid formerly upon the Church or Miniſters, why may not that right be received? For the Magiſtrate, as a Magiſtrate, is bound to do right to the Church, as well as to the Common-wealth; and his encroachment upon Church-privileges, does no more make void that power which he hath from God for doing good to the Church, than it makes void the power that he hath, for doing good to the Common-wealth. The Author of the <hi>Cup of cold Water,</hi> charges them very high, as having paſſed all bounds of Civil Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, p. 4. and yet condemns not Addreſſes to them in civil matters; why then ſhould he condemn Addreſſes to them in Church-matters, becauſe of their paſſing the bounds of that civil Power about Church-matters which they have from God? The main ground upon which he would infer, that there ſhould be no making nor medling with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, is the Supremacy, and other ſins which are mentioned in his Preface, and in the <hi>Cup of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40126:32"/> cold Water,</hi> and in the Hiſtory of the Indulgence</p>
               <p>It ſhould be our earneſt Prayer that the Lord would open the Eyes, and convince the Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſoften the Hearts of our Rulers, that they may in time repent of their ſins; and it's our duty to be humbled, weighted and aſhamed, not only becauſe of our own ſins, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſins of our Rulers; and we have the greater reaſon to take confuſion of face to our ſelves becauſe of their ſins, becauſe it is the ſins of Subjects which ordinarily provokes God to leave their Rulers to their own Luſts, and the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Flatterers and Devils to bring on Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon themſelves and their People.</p>
               <p>We may ſee our ſins in the ſins of Rulers; if Chriſt had been in Truth as he was in Word, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged alone Head and Lord of his own houſe; if his Divine Wiſdom, and Sovereign Will had been only obſerved and followed in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God; and if mens wills, and humours, and conceits, and intereſts, had not been mixed in theſe things; and if thoſe to whom the Lord had given the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, had keeped cloſe to their Spiritual Function, it might have prevented all encroachments upon the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Power of the Church. O that the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would teach Rulers with a ſtrong hand, that no other power is good, but that which is of God, and to God, and no other power but that which is of God, by whom Kings reign, is for their honour and intereſt; all other power is vanity, nothing, and worſe than nothing, and will be to their loſs, ſhame and ſorrow. <hi>Darius</hi> found that that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40126:32"/> which ſeemed to confer too much honour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, in pretending to make him God alone for thirty days, was but a miſerable cheating ſnare; as Flatterers are a great plague to Rulers, ſo wiſe and faithful Inſtructors, Counſellors, and Reprovers, who out of pure Zeal for God, and true love to Rulers, ſhew them what is right and wrong in the ſight of God, are great bleſſings to them.</p>
               <p>It is not every one that is fit to reprove equals, far leſs any Superiors, and leaſt of all Rulers; and it is not every one that hath ſome fitneſs, that is called of God to this work. They who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to it, muſt manage this difficil work with all Wiſdom, Faithfulneſs, love to the perſon of the Ruler, and reſpect to his Authority, that in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering his ſin, his Authority be not brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Contempt. As they muſt not leſſen their ſin, ſo they muſt not make it worſe than it is. If we muſt not lye upon the Devil, far leſs upon thoſe whom the Lord hath called Gods: it were alſo good to ſay nothing of them behind their backs, but what we could ſay to them, if we were called to it, and had acceſs: for to vent things of Rulers behind their backs, and when called to an account, to deny or mince and extenuate, and put another face upon it than it had at firſt, is not ingenuous dealing.</p>
               <p>It is found in ſad experience, that bitter inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives againſt Rulers publiſhed by uncertain Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and which overlaſhes and paſſes the bounds of verity, irritates and provokes Rulers, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40126:33"/> makes them think that ſuch invectives flow from hatred to their perſons, and contempt of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and tempts them to reject the truths which are mixt with theſe falſhoods; and thus many by overdoing, undo all that they intended to do. I wiſh the Author of the Preface, and <hi>Cup of cold Water,</hi> and of the Letters, had not overlaſhed and paſſed the bounds of Truth in their exagera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Magiſtrates ſins, and in uttering things derogatory to their Authority; as for example, that no Magiſtrate either Heathen, Turk or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, ever arrogated ſuch a Supremacy.</p>
               <p>Some have arrogated to themſelves the Deity, and to be God alone, as <hi>Darius</hi> did by ſigning the Decree. <hi>Herod</hi> arrogated to himſelf to be God, and not man. And that allegiance that they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete the apprehenſion of that eternal God, who is above them, would faſten that upon them which many think the greateſt profeſt Atheiſts, though they intend it, yet can never attain unto it, to get the apprehenſion of a Deity raſed out. It's alſo ſaid that they have the purity of enmity at, and implacability againſt all who deſire to be faithful and loyal to Chriſt. And elſewhere it is ſaid, If it be not an abuſe of language to call them Rulers whoſe Goverment is pure Tyranny. They have much real guilt, why ſhould we make our ſelves guilty in alledging upon them that which we cannot prove? The Lord hath forbidden to ſpeak evil of any man, and in a ſpecial manner he hath forbidden to revile Rulers; as we ſhould beware of idolizing Rulers, ſo we ſhould beware
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40126:33"/> of deſpiſing Dignities; if the pains and time that hath been ſpent in telling how our Rulers had been taken up in earneſt Prayers and Endeavours to make them better, it might have been better both for them and us.</p>
               <p>The exaggerating of their ſins to ſcare us from all Addreſſes to them, from all ſeekings and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivings, hath a direct tendency to put them and us in a ſtate of hoſtility, and render us hateful to Rulers, as Perſons who are utterly alienate from them, and will have nothing to do with them. It may ſeem a very cleanly-like conceit to well-meaning people, to forbear all making and med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with Rulers, who have highly provoked the Lord, and vexed his People; but this is but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited cleanlineſs. The firſt Magiſtrate that <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> had to do with, was a grievous Oppreſſor of the Lords People, and an Idolater, and an inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent deſpiſer of God, who makes nothing of God, <hi>Who is the Lord that I ſhould obey his voice, and let</hi> Iſrael <hi>go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let</hi> Iſrael <hi>go:</hi> And yet the Lord ſends <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to him, to deſire him to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go to ſerve him in the Wilderneſs; and after he hath given that blaſphemous inſolent anſwer, full of tempting of God, they inſiſt humbly to pray him to let them go, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. And they are many times after, ſent by the Lord to <hi>Pharoah</hi> with the ſame deſire. It were eaſie to multiply inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this nature, but this one is ſufficient; here are frequent Addreſſes made by the Lords ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to a moſt Godleſs, Atheiſtical Blaſphemer and Perſecutor of the Lords people, and that in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40126:34"/> a religious matter, It's for liberty to go and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God.</p>
               <p>If a company of Chriſtians were taken at Sea, by a company of profligate godleſs Pyrates, who were ſtronger than they, might not the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans deſire of them Liberty to worſhip God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? who will queſtion it? And if an addreſs may be made to ſuch Ruffians, who neither fear God nor regard man, and who have no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the Chriſtians, but keep them Priſoners by ſtrong hand; how much more may Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes be made to the Magiſtrate, who, whatever be his ſins, hath Authority from God to do good, and the ſame Authority that a godly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate hath; and to draw out this power by Petitions, and to take the benefit of the exerciſe of it? When the Magiſtrate doth any good to the Church, and undoeth any ill formerly done, it is not a touching of any unclean thing, but a making uſe of that Authority which is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Ordinance of God. I ſhall ſhut up this with a Teſtimony of precious Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> in his <hi>Divine Right of Church-Government and Excommunication,</hi> Chap. 24. Queſt. 20. pag. 539, 541. <hi>Now the Magiſtrate Heathen, as Magiſtrate, even</hi> Nero, <hi>when the Church of God is in his Court and Dominions, hath the ſame</hi> Jus, <hi>the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Official Power, to be Keeper of both Tables of the Law, and to defend the Goſpel, and to command the Preachers and Synods to fulfil their charge, and to ſee that the Officers do their Duty; and to puniſh dumb Dogs, Idolaters, Excommunicate
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40126:34"/> perſons, to drive away with the Sword falſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from the flock. He hath, I ſay, the ſame Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtratical Power, while he is a Heathen, as when he is converted to the Chriſtian Faith; and he is equally head of men when Heatheniſh, as when Chriſtian.</hi> I ſhall add no more of this, but that as the Magiſtrate hath retracted the Act of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communing made againſt ſeveral of the Subjects, ſo I wiſh that the Author of this new Act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercommuning againſt the Magiſtrate may retract it alſo.</p>
               <p>In the 4th page of the Preface, he ſays of the Indulged Miniſters, That they were men in as ill caſe to have made or medled in the concerns of Chriſt and his Church, with the men with whom they had to do in their circumſtances, as ever any godly men in our Church were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſee this Author hath a way of judging the inward Frames and Caſes of others, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of thoſe who live at a great diſtance from him; not only in regard of place, but alſo of time. By what Evidence he knows the ill caſe of theſe indulged Miniſters at the time of the Indulgence, and by what Evidence he knows the caſes of all the godly men, which have been in this Church, (for this he muſt know, or elſe he could not determine that the Indulged were in as ill caſe as ever any godly men in this Church were) I cannot conjecture. He ſhould either have held his peace of their ill caſe, or elſe he ſhould have inſtanced it; for as he hath left it,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40126:35"/> in this uncharitable time, ſome people may ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect much worſe than any thing he hath to ſay: It may be his Informations and Reaſons may be falſe, or not concludent; and it may be his Reaſons, if he have any, conclude only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome of the indulged; whereas he hath now left it upon them all, that they were in as ill caſe as ever any godly men in this Church were. But ſuppoſe they were in an ill caſe, will that prove, that it was unlawful for them to go and preach in theſe Pariſhes which were either their own, or elſe being deſtitute, invited them? The exerciſe of their Miniſtry might be, through the Bleſſing of God, an excellent means to better their caſe. I have heard it of ſome, who could well judge, that he had heard ſome of theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters before affirm, that they Preached much better ſince their return, than they did before they were put out. If he knew his Brethren to be in an ill caſe, he ſhould have told them of it, and have heard them what they had to ſay, and then have conſidered, whether it were fit to have Printed their Caſe, and Publiſhed it to the world. Whatever truth may appear in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating this further, there is no great appearance of Charity in this Method that he hath taken; as we ſhould think on the things that are true, ſo on the things that are lovely, and ſpeak the truth in Love. What ground the Author hath for this Faith, by which he believes that the ſmothering of what he hath ſaid concerning the ill caſe of his Brethren, would have met him at
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40126:35"/> the Lord's Tribunal, he knows beſt himſelf; but I hope he doth not intend to obtrude his belief upon others, as an evidence of the truth of what he believes. The belief of appearing before the Tribunal, ſhould keep us from raſh judging of our Brethren, Rom. 14.10. <hi>But why doſt thou judge thy Brother?</hi> or, why doſt thou ſet at naught thy Brother? <hi>We ſhall all ſtand before the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt.</hi> And verſ. 4. <hi>Who art thou that judgeſt another mans Servant? to his own Maſter he ſtandeth or falleth.</hi> Matth. 7.1. <hi>Judge not, that ye be not judged.</hi> Jam. 3.1. <hi>My Brethren, be not many Maſters, knowing that we ſhall receive the greater condemnation.</hi> Jam. 4.11. <hi>Speak not evil one of another (Brethren) he that ſpeaks evil of his Brother, and judgeth his Brother, ſpeaketh evil of the Law, and judgeth the Law: but if thou judge the Law, thou art not a doer of the Law, but a judge.</hi> I do not ſee how he can clear himſelf of raſh judging, except he knew certainly the caſe of all the Godly men that have been in the Church; and becauſe Godly men may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a better, and ſometimes in a worſe caſe, he muſt know their caſe when it was at the worſt, or elſe he cannot make a parallel of their Caſe, and the Caſe of the Indulged Miniſters: Or elſe he muſt know, that the Caſe of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Miniſters was ſo ill, that no Godly men could be in a worſe caſe: and how he can cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know the one or the other, except he have it by Revelation, which I think he will not pretend unto, I cannot imagine. I think it would
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40126:36"/> not be raſhneſs to ſay, that his confidence in this matter hath gone further than his evidence could carry it; for as fearleſs and untender as he thinks theſe Indulged Miniſters, I ſuppoſe they would have been afraid to have intruded ſo far in the comparative judging of the illneſs of the caſe of any one godly Miniſter, let be of ſo many.</p>
               <p>In this next Section he charges the Indulged Miniſters with this new ſtep of defection, and ſays, That it hath had moſt deplorable effects, and that it's like to be more fatal to the poor languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remnant, than any ſtep of defection to which ever any godly men were left in the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be found that the Indulged Miniſters have not made defection in their going to exerciſe their Miniſtry in the places to which they are indulged, nor in their Acts that were previous to their going to theſe Congregations, his charge will be found falſe, and he muſt find out ſome other cauſes of theſe deplorable effects of which he ſpeaks, than the practice of theſe Indulged Miniſters. There are many good effects of the exerciſe of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry in theſe Congregations; ſeveral have been converted, many edified and built up in their moſt holy Faith. The renting and ruine of the Church, which he ſpeaks of afterward, will be found to have proceeded from other cauſes, which I love not to name, and not from the Miniſtry of theſe Miniſters in theſe places, or from their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices which went before their Preaching in theſe Congregations.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:40126:36"/>
               <p>The firſt degree of their defection, as we heard before, was this, That they made or medled with the Rulers at all. He is againſt all Addreſſes to them; and therefore according to his opinion, when the Magiſtrate called for theſe Miniſters whom they intended to indulge they ſhould have ſent them word, We will neither make nor meddle with you, nor can we make any Addreſs to you, except it be to tell you we can make none. Now how this could have conſiſted with common ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, and how it could have conſiſted with the duty of any Subjects towards Rulers, eſpecially with the duty of Miniſters, who ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to others in all dutiful, reſpectful beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour towards Superiors, I cannot underſtand; I ſuppoſe the Author will not get many to vote with him in this vote of Non-addreſſes; I doubt much if he was of that opinion himſelf at the time of the firſt Indulgence: but we had enough of this before. 2. He taxes their embracing of the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. 3. their giving thanks to the givers. 4. Their not giving Teſtimony againſt their invaſion. 5. Their going and continuing to exerciſe their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry in theſe Pariſhes to which they were Indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for he deſires them with much earneſtneſs to deliver themſelves from this Indulgence, by relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing thoſe Congregations.</p>
               <p>The embracing and accepting of the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, is taken ordinarily by thoſe who quarrel with the Indulged Miniſters, for an accepting of all that is in the Magiſtrates Acts that relate to the Indulgence, and ſo they alledge they accepted
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40126:37"/> the Inſtructions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this is a manifeſt miſtake, the Indulged Miniſters know beſt themſelves what they did make uſe of in the Magiſtrates In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence; and Mr. <hi>Hutcheſons</hi> ſpeech ſhews what it was that they acknowledged as deſirable and refreſhing to them, even the free liberty of the publick exerciſe of their Miniſtry, under the protection of lawful Authority. They ſhew they had been under a long reſtraint; and this liberty and free liberty (as it is called afterward) of the publick exerciſe of their Miniſtry, is oppoſed to that civil reſtraint which the Magiſtrate had laid on them, by reaſon of which they could not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hazard or great diſturbance, publickly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their Miniſtry, as wanting the Magiſtrates Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and being expoſed to the hazard threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the penal Statutes, which did inhibit the publick exerciſe of the Miniſtry. This publick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, free from this reſtraint; or this publick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exerciſe under the protection of lawful Authority, is the ſame with the publick peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry; this they acknowledge as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and why may they not accept of freedom from reſtraint, which had been upon the publick exerciſe of their Miniſtry, and accept of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of lawful Authority, and give thanks for it? The peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry is a great benefit, and it's acknowledged, that the publick peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry, is by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate; and therefore it was very fit that they ſhould thankfully acknowledge this.</p>
               <p>It is a wonder to me, when I hear men who
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40126:37"/> ſhould have more than common ingenuity, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging ſo confidently, that the Indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters received and accepted their Miniſtry, and Inſtructions to regulate them in their Miniſtry, from the Council; and that they alledge this after they have ſeen what M. <hi>H.</hi> ſpoke in their name, who acknowledges no more as received from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, but liberty or freedom from the reſtraint that had been upon their Miniſtry, and their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of lawful Authority in the exerciſe of it; though he had ſaid no more, I think this ſhould have been ſufficient to have prevented ſuch falſe alledgences; but when he hath ſaid further in the face of the Council, that they received their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry from Jeſus Chriſt, and full preſcriptions from him for regulating them therein, that yet they will alledge that they received their Miniſtry and inſtructions from the Council, is even aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, and ſhews what force humours and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices have upon mens minds.</p>
               <p>I come next to his Queſtions; and he asks, 1. <hi>If they could after this their acceptance and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thanks to the Council, have withdrawn from that appearance, and ſetled themſelves before Chriſt Jeſus the King of his Church, and with a ſweet ſerenity of ſoul have had confidence to offer their thanks to him for being helped to witneſs a good Confeſſion againſt the wickedneſs of this Invaſion made by the overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his work, upon his Royal Prerogative, who built the houſe, and muſt bear the glory; for it was either then or never, that this was to have been done?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:40126:38"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I perceive this Author hath a way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding upon the ſecrets of his Brethren; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he judged and condemned their frame and caſe, ſo here he ſets up a new ſort of Inquiſition, and will have his brethren give an account to him and the World of the ſerenity of their ſouls af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had been before the Council: Although I am in charity bound to think, that theſe Miniſters had this ſerenity of ſoul after what they had done before the Council, and that they can declare this when they find themſelves called thereto; yet I think this new Inquiſition is a dangerous prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative. I ſee not what Authority he hath to put his Brethren to give an account to him, and to the World, of the frame of their ſoul, nor what obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation lieth upon them to give ſuch an account to him; if he have a particular Warrant to erect ſuch an Inquiſition-Court, let him ſhew how he came by it; if he have no particular priviledge for this, then any one may do what he does; and if every one may make ſuch Inquiſition, and all the Lords people and ſervants be obliged to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer every Inquiſitor that ſearches after the ſecrets of their ſouls, this would be much more intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable than the Popiſh Inquiſition, and Auricular Confeſſion; for this makes every man that pleaſes, an Inquiſitor, and obliges the party inquired, not only to round his ſecrets in the ear of one, but to publiſh them to the whole world, and that upon the Inquiſition of perſons who are raſhly ſuſpicious, or prejudged againſt them and their way.</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:40126:38"/>
               <p>How often have good men, after they have done what was good and acceptable to God, been aſſaulted with temptations, and perplexed with doubts and fears, about what they had done? I hope he will not ſay that they were upon the inquiry of perſons prejudged againſt them, and the good which they had done, and who were waiting for their halting, obliged to tell thoſe prejudged perſons and the whole World, that they were under ſuch doubts and fears about what they had done; for beſide many other evils that would follow upon this, it would give occaſion of ſpeaking evil of the good which they had done, and harden thoſe who were adverſaries to the good deed they had done, and might occaſion others to doubt of the lawfulneſs of a good action.</p>
               <p>Beſide, this ſort of Inquiſition, if it ſhould take place, would draw out ſecret ſins to the view of the world, and make them publick ſcandals, and would raiſe ſuſpicions of ſcandals without ground; as for example, if a ſuſpicious perſon might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and oblige any other perſon to anſwer to this queſtion, Could ye, after ye come from ſuch a place or ſuch company, have confidence to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thanks to God for helping you to overcome the temptation ye had to uncleanneſs, theft, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, and to bear witneſs againſt the ſins of the perſons ye were with? If the perſon be ſilent and give no anſwer, the ſuſpicious Inquiſitor will be more confirmed in his ſuſpicion, and readily conclude the man guilty. If the man be really guilty, and yet clears himſelf, he ſins by lying
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40126:39"/> If he confeſs his guilt, he makes a ſcandal in an unwarrantable divulging of his ſin; and though it may be he hath behaved himſelf blameleſly, yet a tender perſon upon ſuch an enquiry may readily be put to a demur, and ſuſpect that he may at leaſt have omitted ſomething which he ought to have done, and ſo cannot give any preſent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſerenity of his foul in that matter, which will encreaſe the ſinful ſuſpiciouſneſs of his Inquiſitor; and though he be altogether blameleſs, and his Conſcience ſerene, yet the very queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch things, is apt to breed ſuſpicions and ſcandals.</p>
               <p>But to come to his Queſtion, His deſign in it is to find the Indulged Miniſters guilty by their own Confeſſion of the neglect of a Teſtimony againſt the wickedneſs of this Invaſion made by the overturners of the Work of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion is, Whether it was the duty of thoſe Miniſters at that time, to give in a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of that nature? He determines, they ſhould have done it then or never. Now he hath ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Queſtion, that whether they anſwer yea or nay, he will conclude them guilty for not giving in ſuch a Teſtimony as he requires at that time; for if they ſay, they were helped to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs a good Confeſſion againſt this wickedneſs, then he will conclude, that then it was duty to give in ſuch a Teſtimony as he requires at that time; for to make a Confeſſion good, it's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that it be ſeaſonable; an unſeaſonable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is not a good Confeſſion, for the ſeaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Confeſſion, is one of thoſe things which
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40126:39"/> are required to the goodneſs of it; and a good thing is made up of intire cauſes, but any defect makes a thing evil.</p>
               <p>Again, it cannot be ſaid, that men with ſereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſoul can have confidence to give Chriſt thanks for helping them to give an unſeaſonable Confeſſion, or a Confeſſion out of ſeaſon. But again, if they anſwer, that they were not helped by Chriſt to give ſuch a good Confeſſion; then he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that they are guilty of neglecting to give in that Confeſſion at that time, ſeeing it was a good Confeſſion, and ſo ſeaſonable, which if they had given, they would have done it by the help of Chriſt, and would have had matter of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving; and ſeeing they have not done it, they have not been helped by him to that which was good and their duty at that time. Thus whether they anſwer his Queſtion affirmatively or nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, he will conclude them guilty.</p>
               <p>The Author made his Addreſs, as he ſays, not as an acute diſputant, but as a poor, blunt, plain, open-hearted man, in a few plain Queſtions; he ſhould not after ſuch a profeſſion of plain-deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the very Entry, begun with Sophiſtry, with a Caption from many Interrogations. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.8. <hi>Reprove not a Scorner, leſt he hate thee.</hi> So that a man may forbear to reprove a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and yet not be guilty of a ſinful neglect; but by ſuch a captious Queſtion as this, any man who hath been with, and heard Scorners, will be found guilty; for if ye ſpear at him, were ye helped by Chriſt to witneſs a good Confeſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch a Scorner, or to give a good reproof
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40126:40"/> to ſuch a ſcorner? if he anſwer, that he was not helped to give him a good reproof, then ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that he omitted good, and ſo ſinned in not reproving him; whereas <hi>Solomon</hi> forbids to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove him. If he ſay, he gave him a good reproof, then he calls that good which the Scripture for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth; or if this queſtion be moved to one who hath not reproved a man when he was not in a caſe to receive reproof, ſuppoſe when in drink, or in the height of rage, or when in ſuch diſtemper, and under ſuch prejudice, as the reproving of him would hinder him from doing ſome good that he were about to do, and in all probability make him worſe; if the perſon perceive not the captiouſneſs and ſophiſtry of the Queſtion, but anſwer yea or nay, he will be intangled; but ſuch may eaſily anſwer the Queſtion thus, 1. That they did not reprove ſuch a perſon in ſuch a caſe: and 2. That it was not good to reprove him in ſuch a caſe, or at ſuch a time; and that therefore he was not guilty of neglecting a good reproof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not ſeaſonable to reprove at that time.</p>
               <p>If the Prefacer would have dealt as plainly as he promiſed, he ſhould have plainly proved, that theſe Miniſters ſhould at that time have given in ſuch a Teſtimony as he requireth. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that requires the making of Confeſſion, is an affirmative Precept; and though it be obliged at all times, yet doth not oblige to give a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony at all times; we muſt never deny the truth, but we muſt not ever make Confeſſion of it, as all Caſuiſts grant. We do not hear that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40126:40"/> 
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> made any formal proteſtation againſt <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Blaſphemy and avowed Rebellion againſt God; they heard him ſay, <hi>Who is the Lord that I ſhould obey his voice, to let</hi> Iſrael <hi>go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let</hi> Iſrael <hi>go:</hi> They make no Proteſtation nor Declaration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this blaſphemous Speech, and avowed Rebellion againſt God; they only ſhew their Warrant, and humbly inſiſt in their Petition: and yet theſe extraordinary Embaſſadours of God, were in another manner of capacity for doing this, if it had been neceſſary and ſeaſonable, than ordinary Miniſters are; read <hi>Exod.</hi> 5.2, 3. Nor do we hear that the other Children gave any writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten or verbal Proteſtation againſt the making of the Image, and Proclaimation to worſhip it: Nor did <hi>Daniel</hi> give any written, ſubſcribed, or verbal Declaration againſt the making, ſigning, publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Decree which diſcharged all Petitions to be given to any for thirty days, but to <hi>Darius,</hi> which was to make him God alone: All that they did, was, they did not obey, but acted contrary to thoſe godleſs Decrees, and chuſed rather to ſuffer death than obey them. Nor did our Saviour ſpeak any thing before <hi>Herod,</hi> though a vile man, when he was before him. Chriſt held his peace a long time before the Council, and when he ſpoke, he gave in no written or verbal Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation againſt the Council, it's conſtitution and corruptions, nor againſt the ſentence they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt him as a Blaſphemer. Nor when <hi>Paul</hi> compeared at <hi>Rome,</hi> do we hear of any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation againſt the monſtrous abominations and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40126:41"/> perſecutions of <hi>Nero.</hi> Many Martyrs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors did forbear to make publick Proteſtation againſt the Idols and Idolatry of their Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and all that many of them ſaid, was this, <hi>That they were Chriſtians, and upon that ſuffered.</hi> How many, both private Chriſtians and Miniſters, have appeared before the Council, ſince the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy was eſtabliſhed, who did not think themſelves obliged to give in a written or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal Confeſſion, Teſtimony, or Proteſtation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Supremacy, and the Invaſions made upon the Government of the Church? and yet the Author of this Epiſtle urges none of theſe with his Queries; but only the Indulged Miniſters, though they have ſomewhat to ſay for their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of any ſuch Proteſtation which others had not, ſeeing they were called to the Council in a time when the Magiſtrate was relenting ſomewhat as to the ſeverity formerly uſed, and they were called to get ſome relaxation from the reſtraint laid formerly upon them; and their irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating of the Magiſtrate, might not only have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged themſelves of that freedom, but alſo have been prejudicial to others who were in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, who might very readily have blamed them for their imprudency in triſting their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation with that ſeaſon, not only to their own prejudice, but to the prejudice of others. And I leave it to the Conſideration of indifferent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whether or not the Magiſtrate would in all probability have ſaid, Theſe men and others of them made no Proteſtation againſt us when we turned them out, and ſubverted their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40126:41"/> but now when we begin to ſhew favour to any of them, they grow more inſolent, and therefore it's beſt policy to forbear our favours, and to uſe ſeverities. And ſeeing all theſe Brethren, and the whole Presbyterians in <hi>Scotland,</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Invaſions made upon the Church, and were concerned in the bad effects that might have followed upon the irritation of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in that juncture of Affairs; if it had been fit for a few private Miniſters, without the concurrence of all concerned, or at leſt without their counſel and advice, to have given in ſuch a Teſtimony or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation as the Author requires: and it's well known that no ſuch concurrence was offered, nor ſuch advice given to theſe Miniſters by the reſt of their Judgment, who were concerned in this matter.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not repeat what the Author of the Anſwer to the <hi>Countrey-mans Scruples</hi> anent the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, hath ſaid, concerning Teſtimonies, in which he hath ſhewed from Scripture and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Reaſon, the raſhneſs and unreaſonableneſs of thoſe who have condemned the ſuffering Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and the Indulged Miniſters, for not giving Teſtimonies: He hath excellently diſcovered from Scripture when Teſtimonies are to be given, and when not; when they are ſeaſonable, and when unſeaſonable: He hath alſo ſhewed how written Teſtimonies which Synods had prepared when Prelacy was coming in, particularly the Synod of <hi>Fife,</hi> were obſtructed by the Magiſtrates raiſing of theſe Synods; and that they who had no clearneſs to make any uſe of the Indulgence, did obſtruct the written Teſtimony which was
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40126:42"/> prepared againſt the evils which were in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex acts, which related to the Indulgence; he hath alſo ſhewed how many Teſtimonies have been given by word in Preaching, and before the Council, and by ſuffering, and by not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Inſtructions of the Council.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only ſhew, that the Miniſters, who firſt appeared before the Council, at the firſt Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, did witneſs a good Confeſſion in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Council.</p>
               <p>They declare that they had received their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry from Jeſus Chriſt; and after deſign them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt: They ſpeak of their Miniſtry as <hi>Paul</hi> did of his Miniſtry, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.24. <hi>The Miniſtry,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> And by the way we may take notice, that the Miniſtry is not a meer Power or Authority, but comprehends the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of that Authority, the exerciſe of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Office; for <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of finiſhing the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry which he had received, which unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably points at the exerciſe of his Miniſtry; and they deſign themſelves as <hi>Paul</hi> deſigns Miniſters, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Let a man ſo account of us, as of the Miniſters of Chriſt.</hi> 2 Cor. 11.23. <hi>Are they Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt? I ſpeak as a fool, I am more.</hi> They who quarrel this part of their Confeſſion, muſt fall firſt upon the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> or rather upon the Holy Ghoſt; for the Apoſtle ſpoke as he was moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They declare that they had received from Chriſt full preſcriptions for regulating them in their Miniſtry; as they had acknowledged Chriſt
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40126:42"/> the giver of the Miniſtry, ſo they acknowledge him the Law-giver from whom they have the preſcriptions to regulate them in the Miniſtry, both in their entrance into it, and exerciſe of it: then they declare that theſe preſcriptions of Chriſts are full. This excludes all other preſcriptions, though they had ſaid no more but that they had received preſcriptions from Chriſt to regulate them; this would have ſufficiently excluded all other preſcriptions: For the preſcriptions being the preſcriptions of God, we muſt not diminiſh from them; and ſo we muſt not admit any Rules contrary to them, or that derogate any way from them; and we muſt not add unto them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are his words, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.5, 6. <hi>Every word of God is pure—add thou not to his words, leſt he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.</hi> And then ſeeing Chriſt hath given theſe preſcriptions to regulate Miniſters in their Miniſtry, this ſhews that theſe preſcriptions are a perfect Rule; a Rule muſt be perfect, elſe it is not a Rule, as our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines maintain againſt the Papiſts in pleading for the perfection of the Scripture; ſeeing Chriſt hath given preſcriptions to his Miniſters to regulate them in their Miniſtry, theſe preſcriptions are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, elſe they were not ſufficient to reach the end of regulating. His work is perfect, he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in his houſe, as a ſon over his own houſe, he hath finiſhed all the work that was given him to do.</p>
               <p>But when they further aſſert, that theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions were full, this did clearly exclude all other preſcriptions for regulating them in their
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40126:43"/> Miniſtry as ſuperfluous, and as Additions to that which God had made full and perfect; but laſt of all, this is one of the Lords preſcriptions, that we ſhould not add to his Word, nor diminiſh from it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. Again, that is another of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, <hi>that they do all in the Name of the Lord Jeſus:</hi> And ſeeing they are the Miniſters of Chriſt, and their work, the work of the Miniſtry, received from Chriſt, any that will not ſhut their eyes may ſee that they behoved to be regulated by his preſcriptions alone in the matter of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They confeſs Chriſt to be their Judge to whom they were countable in the diſcharge of their Miniſtry: for theſe are the words which Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon</hi> ſpoke in their name, <hi>We have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived our Miniſtry from Jeſus Chriſt, with full preſcriptions from him for regulating us therein; and muſt in diſcharge thereof be accountable to him.</hi> This doth clearly evidence that they behoved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their greateſt peril to adhere cloſely to theſe preſcriptions which they had received from the Lord Jeſus: Seeing they were to give an account unto Chriſt how they had diſcharged their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry according to his full preſcriptions, and that they could receive no other preſcriptions beſides Chriſts preſcriptions to regulate them in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their Miniſtry.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They declare how deſirable and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the exerciſe of this their Miniſtry was to them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They declare what power they acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Magiſtrate; it's not a lawleſs but lawfu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="6">6. That they purpoſed and reſolved to behave themſelves in the diſcharge of their Miniſtry with that wiſdom and prudence which became faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. They declare that they continued in their known judgment in Church-affairs; they did let the Magiſtrates know that they had not altered their Judgement in Church-affairs, that they were ſtill Presbyterians;<note place="margin">Their judgment is known from the Confeſſion of faith, chap. <hi>23.</hi> Art. <hi>3.</hi> ch. <hi>25.</hi> Art. <hi>6.</hi> ch. <hi>30.</hi> Art. <hi>1.</hi> ch. <hi>31.</hi> Art. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> and all who have any knowledge of the Judgment of Presbyterians, know that they own Chriſt for the alone head of the Church, and fountain of Church-au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and that they are as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to Eraſtianiſm as they are to Prelacy. That they are ſo far from aſcribing a Supremacy of ſpiritual power to the Magiſtrate, that they profeſs that the Magiſtrate hath not any power of the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven committed to him; and that it doth not belong to the Magiſtrate to ordain or depoſe, ſuſpend, excommunicate, or to exerciſe any Church-cenſures; and that it doth not belong to him to form Church-Canons, or to preſcribe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions for regulating Miniſters in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry; and that they are of that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40126:44"/> that no Magiſtrate, nay, nor all the powers on earth, though they were united, can diſpoſe of Eccleſiaſtical matters according to their Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or pleaſure; ſeeing the things of the houſe of the God of Heaven, muſt be done according to the wiſdom and pleaſure of the Lord, and not according to the wiſdom and pleaſure of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>Theſe and many other Tenets are known by all who know what Presbyterians are, to be their known and profeſſed Judgement. Now ſeeing they declared their continuance in their known Judgement, and adherence to their former prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and that to the Magiſtrate, and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before their reſolutions to behave as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters of Chriſt, and that they believed the account they were to give of their Miniſtry to Jeſus Chriſt. They did ſhew to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that they did not, nor could not approve of power or acts of the Magiſtrate which were contrary to their Judgements; for that had been ſo far from becoming the faithfulneſs of the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, that it could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with common Ingenuity.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And they clearly enough inſinuate that there was an oppoſition betwixt their known Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and the actings of the Magiſtrate in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Presbyterial Government, and ſetting up of Prelacy, and other actings contrary to Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial Principles; ſome whereof I mentioned before: This oppoſition is clearly inſinuated and imported, while they ſay, <hi>And to demain our ſelves towards lawful Authority, notwithſtanding of our
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40126:44"/> known Judgment in Church-affairs, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh Loyal Subjects:</hi> for if the Affairs of the Church had been then according to their known Judgment, that [notwithſtanding] had been impertinent, and could have had no ſufferable ſence. But Church-affairs being ſetled by the Magiſtrate, contrary to the known Judgment of Presbyterians, ſome might have alledged, that Presbyterian Miniſters would not be Loyal to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards lawful Authority; to obviate this they ſay, That notwithſtanding their known Judgements, they would behave as Loyal Subjects.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And hence they declare to the Magiſtrate that there was no diſloyalty in their Principles or practice; of their Principles, that their known judgement in Church-affairs, and the faithful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcharge of their Miniſtry, according to their known Judgement, did well conſiſt with loyalty, and with that reſpect which from a principle of Conſcience they did owe to lawful Authority, though it did not conſiſt with ſome of the actings of thoſe who were in Authority.</p>
               <p n="10">10. They modeſtly declare the low eſteem they they had of themſelves, in ſaying they were the unworthieſt of many of their Brethren; and they ſo far from ſelfiſhneſs, in deſiring to partake of this liberty alone, that they expreſs their deſire that others of their Brethren may be ſharers of the liberty which they enjoyed.</p>
               <p>It appears from what is ſaid, that theſe Breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren witneſſed a good Confeſſion before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; and the Author of the Hiſtory of the-Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, hath in this reſpect done right to theſe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40126:45"/> Brethren, and good ſervice to the Church, in Printing the Speech which Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon</hi> ſpoke in their name before the Council. If any object, that their Teſtimony is not good, becauſe they do not expreſly and <hi>in terminis</hi> teſtifie againſt the Invaſions made upon the Church. I would deſire theſe to conſider, that in ſaying ſo, they condemn the Teſtimonies of many Martyrs, who in their Confeſſions only expreſſed the truths which they did believe; and ſome of them only in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral aſſerted that they were Chriſtians. They condemn alſo our Confeſſion of Faith, which doth not ſo expreſly, and in ſo many words refute and reject many dangerous and damnable errors, but doth only aſſert the truths oppoſite to theſe errors; yea, they condemn the Teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt in the Scriptures, which is good and perfect, and yet doth not <hi>in terminis,</hi> and expreſly mention every error which is contrary to the truth, but leaves the refutation of many of theſe errors to be gathered by good conſequence from what is ſaid in the Holy Scriptures; and they condemn alſo that good Confeſſion which Chriſt witneſſed before <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> in aſſerting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a King; for he doth not expreſly mention and reject all the errors which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Spiritual Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing I am ſpeaking of Teſtimonies, I ſhall mention what the Indulged Miniſters, who were called before the Council for not keeping the 29. of <hi>May,</hi> declared in the face of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. As they had agreed, that Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon</hi> ſhould declare that the Magiſtrate had not a power for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40126:45"/> Eccleſiaſtical, and that they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Rules intrinſecally Eccleſiaſtical from the Magiſtrate: So Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon</hi> to prevent the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils giving them any ſuch inſtructions, deſired that their Lordſhips would be pleaſed not to burden them with impoſitions in the matter of their Miniſtry, wherein they were the Servants of Chriſt. And after Mr. <hi>Alexander Blare,</hi> who was called before Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon,</hi> had ſhewed that he could not receive ſuch inſtructions to regulate him in his Miniſtry; Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was called, ſpoke againſt their <hi>L. L.</hi> impoſing Rules intrinſecally Eccleſiaſtical for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating Miniſters in the exerciſe of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, who were the Servants of Chriſt in theſe matters: And after when he was called, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that a formal Eccleſiaſtick power could not be allowed to the Magiſtrate; and ſeveral others of them ſpoke to the ſame purpoſe. As theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters have not received theſe Inſtructions, ſo they have declared to the Council, that they could not receive them; beſide what we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from M. <hi>Hutcheſons</hi> Speech at the firſt Indulgence, there are here other things obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That he deſigns them Impoſitions, and ſo he ſhews that they looked upon them as incroaching and intrenching upon their Miniſterial calling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In aſſerting, that the Magiſtrate had not a power formally Eccleſiaſtical, he teſtified againſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſtianiſm;</hi> and did further ſhew, <hi>That the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates work is not to form Rules or Inſtructions which are formally Eccleſiaſtical; for all Acts which
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40126:46"/> are intrinſecally and formally Eccleſiaſtical, muſt be elicite by a power which is formally Eccleſiaſtical; the giving inſtructions formally Eccleſiaſtical, is the formal effect of an Eccleſiaſtical Inſtructor; as it is not proper for the Magiſtrate, but for Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians to give medicinal Receits, which muſt be drawn from the art or faculty of Medicine; Nor is it proper for the Magiſtrate to make a Phyſical Directory to regulate Phyſitians in their giving of Phyſical Receits; for this were an intrenching and breaking in upon the Phyſitians Calling. So it is not proper for the Magiſtrate to make Rules in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally Eccleſiaſtical; for theſe muſt be drawn from the Word of God, ſeeing they are for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the Matters of God; and when there is need of forming any ſuch Rules or Inſtructions, it's the proper Work of thoſe to whom the publick Explication and Application of the Word of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs: The forming of ſuch Canons, hath in all Ages been the work of Eccleſiaſtical Synods, who had not the power of the Sword; and conſequently the forming of ſuch Rules is not an Act of the power of the Sword.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In aſſerting, <hi>That in their Miniſtry, and theſe matters which were the exerciſe of it, they were the Servants of Chriſt; they did ſhew that they could not admit of any Impoſitions which would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice their Maſters ſervice; and that in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters they were not at their own diſpoſal, and muſt not act</hi> ex proprio arbitrio, <hi>nor</hi> pro hominum im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perio, <hi>but</hi> ex Chriſti obſequio; <hi>that is, That they were neither to be ruled by their own will, nor the will of men, but by the will of Chriſt in theſe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40126:46"/> Matters. They did put in the words formally and intrinſecally Eccleſiaſtical, becauſe the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate may make civil laws about Church-matters, as is acknowledged in the ſecond Book of Diſcipline, Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>where it is ſaid, That he may make Civil Laws and Conſtitutions agreeable to Gods word, for the advancement of the Kirk and policy thereof, though he may not make Canons intrinſecally Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe were good Confeſſions made before the Magiſtrate by the Indulged Miniſters, and the fulleſt I know hath been made by any before the Magiſtrate: Although perſons while they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der perjudices againſt theſe Miniſters, make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of any thing theſe ſay or do; yet when theſe humours and perjudices are removed, and the carriage of theſe Miniſters is impartially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, ingenuous and unbyaſſed perſons will not only clear them of the unjuſt aſperſions caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, but commend them, and wonder that that they have been ſo unjuſtly abuſed, and that they have ſo long born ſo many injuries with ſo great patience. The attempts of the Author of the Hiſtory of the Indulgence, to make nothing of theſe Teſtimonies, as they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the ſtrength of humour and prejudice, ſo the vanity of his attemps will appear when we come to examine them. I come to the ſecond Queſtion in the Epiſtle to the Reader.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſaith he, <hi>let me ask, Are they ſo very clear and confident in the caſe, that they cannot on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in dealing with men, hold up their face, and affirm without hink or heſitation, that this is their
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40126:47"/> rejoycing, even the Teſtimony of their Conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſdom, but by the grace of God they have had their Converſation before all men, and more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly towards theſe backſliding Rulers, before whom they appeared, now declared enemies to the work of God, and Invaders of his Throne and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative? But are they alſo content to be carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Tribunal of Chriſt with this acceptance from thoſe which have exauctorate their Lord and Maſter in their hand, and to have the quality of their love to the coming of his Kingdom, and their Loyalty unto Chriſt Jeſus now oppoſed, and put from the exerciſe of his Royal Government by the party indulging in this very Indulgence, tried by ſuch a teſt? It were fit ſure to think on this, and lay it to heart, for each Receiver may lay his account with it, that ſoon or ſyne he ſhall be put to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Before I come to anſwer this Queſtion, I cannot but advertiſe him, that in ſaying, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any limitation or reſtriction, that not only the Magiſtrate hath exauctorate Chriſt, but alſo that Chriſt is put from the exerciſe of his Royal Government, he hath laid a ſtumbling-block be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore weak and ignorant people, which may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion them to imagine that Chriſt is quite van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, and denied of all Authority, and put from all exerciſe of his Kingly Office. There are ſuch looſe Rhetorications in the <hi>Cup of cold Water,</hi> which may occaſion ſimple people to think, that Chriſt is quite diſpoſſeſt of his Crown and Throne. If any will read the Anſwer to that Queſtion in the larger Catechiſm, How doth
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40126:47" rendition="simple:additions"/> Chriſt execute the Office of a King? they will ſee, that he exerciſes his Kingly Office, not only by Governing his Church viſibly, in calling it out of the World, in giving Officers, Laws and Cenſures, but alſo in beſtowing ſaving Grace upon the Elect; rewarding them for their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, correcting them for their ſins, preſerving and ſupporting them under all their temptations and ſufferings, reſtraining and overcoming all their enemies, and powerfully ordering all things for his own Glory, and their own good; and alſo in taking vengeance on the reſt who know not God, and obey not the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Now I ſuppoſe the Author of the Letter, will not imagine that the Magiſtrate intended to put Chriſt from the exerciſe of his Royal Government, as to many of theſe Acts of his Kingly Office. It's a ſad truth, that the Magiſtrate hath ſubvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Presbyterial Government, which is a part of the viſible Kingdom of Chriſt; but it is not the all of Chriſts Kingdom; wherever there is a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church called out of the World, where the Word of God is preached, where the truth is born witneſs to, and the Sacraments Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, there Chriſt executeth his Kingly Office, and there is ſomething of his viſible Kingdom. I do not think that the Author of the Epiſtle will ſay, that the Magiſtrate intended that there ſhould be no Church, nor any Preaching of the Word of God in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. What ever may be ſaid of the Act of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, which is ſo terribly vaſt, that even Mr. <hi>Burnet</hi> in his laſt <hi>Dialogues</hi> inſinuates, that it
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40126:48"/> cannot bear a ſtrict <hi>examen;</hi> and that ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in it muſt carry with them a tacite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; yet it is manifeſtly falſe that the Act of Indu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gence did any way oppoſe the exerciſe of Chriſts Royal Government; for the Act of Indulgence allowed Chriſts Miniſters to preach the Goſpel of the Kingdom, to keep Kirk-Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which is one of Chriſts Courts.</p>
               <p>As for the Queſtion; I wonder how he dare call the ſimplicity and godly ſincerity of theſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in queſtion, or how he durſt doubt of their Loyalty to Chriſt, and of their love to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Kingdom. I am bound to think, that it was the deſire which they had of the coming of his Kingdom, which moved them to deſire the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry, that they might make full proof of it in Preaching, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing, celebrating the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, Catechiſing, Viſiting, exerciſing Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline without diſturbance, which they could not have attained in an unſetled ambulatory Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. As theſe Miniſters think themſelves bound to praiſe the Lord, and to be thankful to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate for the peaceable exerc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, ſo they could not according to theſe thoughts that they then had, and ſtill have, with peace in their Conſciences, refuſe to take this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the peaceable, ſetled exerciſe of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.</p>
               <p>I would enquire of him how he knows that this acceptance of freedom from that reſtraint which had been upon the publick exerciſe of their Miniſtry, will be a teſt before the Tribunal of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40126:48"/> Chriſt, by which their love to the coming of his Kingdom, and their Loyalty to Chriſt will be tried. Acceptance of a freedom of this nature, if conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſimply in it's own nature, is no teſt of love to Chriſt, or Loyalty to him; becauſe this is a favour, that a Miniſter void of Grace, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of, and take, as any man who is reſtrained from the exerciſe of his calling whereby he hath his livelihood, will willingly accept of freedom from that reſtraint. And ſo a Miniſter who hath no love to Chriſt, who hath been reſtrained from the exerciſe of the Miniſtry, will willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of a relaxation from that reſtraint; and therefore this acceptance ſimply conſidered, being a thing common, and not a thing accompanying Salvation, is not capable of being a mark or teſt of Love or Loyalty to Chriſt. It were an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent and fooliſh Queſtion if one ſhould come to a poor man come out of Priſon, with this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Are ye content to be carried before the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of Chriſt with your acceptance of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from your Priſon in your hand, as a teſt of your love to Chriſt? If the man had any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he would anſwer, that acceptance of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from Impriſonment, is common both to good and bad; and therefore he behoveth to ſeek for other marks and teſts of his love to Chriſt: if he would further urge and ſay, If your coming out of Priſon, be not a teſt of your love to Chriſt, and your Loyalty to him, then it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for you to come out of Priſon. The man might anſwer, that there are many things law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and commendable, which are not marks and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40126:49"/> teſts of Love and Loyalty to Chriſt. Now it ſeems this is the thing that he would be at, that if this acceptance of freedom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be not a teſt or mark of Love or Loyalty to Chriſt, that then it was ſinful. I think it a ſtrange thing to ſee a rational man profeſſing, and as I ſuppoſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning plainneſs, making ſuch captious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Queſtions. I ſhall not ſay, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Queſtions are the Queſtions of a blunt man; but all the point I can perceive in his plain Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, is in the captious confuſedneſs of them.</p>
               <p>His third Queſtion is; <hi>If they believe that Chriſt who purchaſed his Church,</hi> &amp;c. In this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, if the Indulged Miniſters believe that Chriſt who purchaſed his Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> lives to make Interceſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And there are ſome things which he ſuppoſes the Indulged Brethren will not, nor cannot deny, which are not ſo clear as to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the poſſibility of denyal; as for example, That Chriſt procures by vertue of the price he hath paid, the execution of the written ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon all who ſtrive with him for ſtate and ſupremacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And afterward, That the Mediator who is ſet down at the right hand of God, intercedes and pleads by his blood, by his wounds and paſſion, for the execution of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed and promiſed vengeance. I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that I have read this before, that the price Chriſt hath paid, doth procure vengeance; the purchaſing and promiſing of vengeance, are expreſſions new to me; mens ſins procure or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve vengeance, and God threatens vengeance. Purchaſes and Promiſes are of things that are
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40126:49"/> good. I ſhall only move this Queſtion, By what evidence was he aſſured, that none of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Miniſters would or could deny, that Chriſt intercedes and pleads by his blood, by his wounds and paſſion, for the execution of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance? I do not remember, that ever I heard or read this aſſertion, that Chriſt intercedes by his blood for vengeance, before I read it in this Epiſtle; and I have had occaſion to ſpeak with others who were ſurpriſed with it, as an uncouth and ſtrange aſſertion, which they had never heard before; and therefore there was great raſhneſs to alledge, that none of the Indulged Miniſters would or could deny ſuch an uncouth aſſertion, which is neither clear by it's own innate light, nor commonly received among Divines; yea, it is ſo far from being an opinion commonly received, that I know not if the Author of the Epiſtle will find any who have uſed ſuch expreſſions as theſe which he uſes in this matter. I find ſeveral Divines reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Chriſts Prieſtly Interceſſion unto the Elect; and they look upon his Prieſtly Office, as an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Grace; and herein they diſtinguiſh Chriſts Kingly and Prieſtly Office, which the <hi>Socinians</hi> would confound; that the Prieſtly Office, and that part of it, the Prieſtly Interceſſion, is for the Elect, and is not for puniſhing of enemies, as the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office is. <hi>Eſſenius</hi> in his <hi>Triumphus Crucis,</hi> pag. 279. ſhews the diſtinction of the Kingly and Prieſtly Office of Chriſt, by aſcribing to the Prieſtly Office the Sacrifice and Interceſſion, and the puniſhing of enemies to the Kingly Office, and after in the ſame page he ſhews, <hi>That the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40126:50"/> differs much from the Kingly Acts, among which Kingly Acts he reckoneth the compeſcing or quaſhing of enemies;</hi> and he ſheweth, <hi>That even</hi> Crellius, <hi>though he labour to confound the Kingly and Prieſtly Office of Chriſt, yet he aſſigns ſome differences, and this is one, That it belongs to Chriſt, as a King, to puniſh; but to him, as a Prieſt, it belongs only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate the ſins of the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Mareſius</hi> in his Syſtems of Theology, in his 10. Common-place, Theſ. 57. taxeth the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> for confounding Chriſts Kingly Office with his Prieſtly; and in his Annotations ſubjoyned to his laſt Edition of that Syſtem, he ſays, <hi>As theſe two Offices muſt not be divided, or drawn aſſunder, or ſeparate, ſo they ſhould not be confounded; for Chriſts Prieſtly Interceſſion in Heaven, is only for the Elect, but his Royal Power is exerciſed, as in calling and protecting the Elect, ſo alſo in reſtraining, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſcing, and puniſhing the enemies of his Church;</hi> and in that ſame 10th. Chap. Theſ. 55. Annot. A. <hi>In which reſpect, the blood of the New Covenant is ſaid to cry for better things than the blood of Abel,</hi> Heb. 12.24. <hi>for the blood of Abel requireth ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneance, but the blood of Chriſt ſeeks and obtains Grace and Peace.</hi> And the excellent Doctor <hi>Owen</hi> in his Exercitations prefixed to the Continuation of the Expoſition on the 3, 4, 5. Chapters of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Exercitat. 8. pag. 117. ſaith, <hi>For neither did Chriſt as King, expiate and purge our ſins, which could be done only by a bloody Sacrifice; nor doth he as Prieſt ſubdue his enemies and ours, which is the work, and whereunto the power of a King is required — in brief, as a Prieſt,

And thereon it is conſented alſo, that it is in it's entire nature diſtinct from the Kingly Power and Office.</hi> Pag. 124. <hi>For every Prieſt, as we have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, acts in the name, and on the hehalf of men with God; but a King in the name, and on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of God, with and towards men, as to the ends of that rule which God hath ordained. The Prieſt repreſents men to God, pleading their cauſe; the King repreſents God to men, acting his Power — for all the acts of the Prieſtly Office, belongs to obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and interceſſion; and theſe effects conſiſts either in</hi> 1. Averruncatione mali, <hi>or</hi> procuratione boni; <hi>theſe they affect morally only by procuring and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of them.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40126:51"/> that he made reconciliation for the ſins of the people, and Interceſſion for Tranſgreſſors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall only add one other, and that is <hi>Thomas Goodwin B. D.</hi> in his Treatiſe entituled, <hi>The heart of Chriſt in Heaven, to ſinners on earth,</hi> Part. 2. 188. <hi>Firſt,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this Office of High-Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, is an Office erected wholly for the ſhewing of Grace and Mercy, — the Office of the High-Prieſthood, is altogether an Office of Grace, and I may call it the Pardon-Office, ſet up and erected by God in Heaven, and Chriſt he is appointed the Lord and Miniſter of it; and as his Kingly Office, is an Office of Power and Dominion, and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Office, an Office of Knowledge and Wiſdom; ſo his Prieſtly Office is an Office of Grace and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; the High-Prieſts Office did properly deal in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe; if there had not been a Mercy-ſeat in the Holy of Holies, the High-Prieſt had not been at all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to go into it; it was mercy, reconciliation, and atonement for ſinners, that he was to treat about, and ſo to Officiate for at the Mercy-ſeat; he had other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways no work, nor any thing to do, when he ſhould come into the moſt Holy place. Now this was but a typical alluſion to this Office of Chriſt in Heaven; and therefore the Apoſtle in the Text, when he ſpeaks of this our High Prieſts being entered into Heaven, he makes mention of a Throne of Grace—and this is the very next words to my Text, Chap.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. verſes, <hi>in which he gives a full deſcription of an High-Prieſt, and all the properties and requiſites, that were to be in him.</hi> Pag. 189. <hi>the great and eſſential qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications there ſpecified, that were to be in an High-Prieſt, are Mercy and Grace.—It's ſaid he was
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40126:52"/> ordained for men.—that is, for mens cauſe, and for their good</hi>—pag. 190. <hi>thus you ſee the ends which he is ordained for, are all matter of Grace and Mercy—the qualification that was required in an High-Prieſt, was, That he ſhould be one that could have Compaſſion—Mercy and Compaſſion is that which is here made the ſpecial, and therefore the only mentioned property of the High-Prieſt as ſuch, and the ſpecifical eſſential qualification that was inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and internally to conſtitute him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reader will find much more to this purpoſe in the place cited; but from what hath bin cited from the Authors mentioned, whoſe Books are common, and no doubt have been ſeen by the Author of the Epiſtle, he might have ſeen, that it was great raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſuppoſe that none would or could deny, that Chriſt by his blood did intercede for vengeance.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Authors mentioned, have a far other up-taking of Chriſts Prieſtly Office, and of that part of it, his Prieſtly Interceſſion by his blood; for they think his Prieſtly Office was wholly an Office of Grace, and altogether an Office of Grace, founded in Grace and Mercy and that Mercy is an eſſential qualification of a Prieſt, as a Prieſt; that it's an Office for men for expiating ſin, and not for puniſhing it; that the deſigne of it is mercy and grace; that the Prieſtly interceſſion is only for the Elect, and in this diſtinguiſhed from Chriſts Royal Power, which as it is for protecting the Elect, ſo it is for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the enemies of his Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſuppoſe Chriſt did intercede by his blood againſt ſome; I enquire at him, how he
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40126:52" rendition="simple:additions"/> knows that he intercedes by his blood for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon the Authors of the Indulgence? what knows he but ſome of them may be elect? I am ſure he will not ſay that the blood of Chriſt which was ſhed on earth for the Elect, doth plead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them within the vail in Heaven; if he ſay, that he knows they are all Reprobates, he knows more than the Author of the <hi>Cup of cold Water</hi> knew in the year 1678. for pag. 40. he ſays, <hi>It may be there are ſome of the Elect ſo far left at preſent, as to run along with this courſe.</hi> I hope he will not take on him to ſay, They have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. If by ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance he mean eternal vengeance, he muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them Reprobates; if he mean temporal vengeance, how knows he that Chriſts blood pleads for that? We ſee <hi>Aaron</hi> as Prieſt, ſtood betwixt the dead and the living to ſtay the Plague; he made an atonement to avert the wrath of God, and not to bring it on; <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.46, 47, 48. And the Plague which came after the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of the people, is ſtayed by building an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,<note place="margin">It belonged to the Prieſt as Prieſt, to bleſs in the name of the Lord for ever, <hi>2 Chron. 23.13.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and offering burnt-offerings and peace-offerings,</hi> 2 Sam. 24.25. Again, whatſoever Chriſt intercedes for by his blood, he obtaineth it; now how knows he, that temporal ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance will certainly come upon the Authors of the Indulgence? May not Sovereign grace avert the temporal judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which mens heinous ſins have deſerved? who can ſet bounds to the Grace of God, <hi>who hath Mercy on whom he will have Mercy,</hi> and hath
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40126:53"/> ſhewed mercy to ſome of thoſe who were the chief of ſinners?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Suppoſe that were granted, that Chriſt did by his blood intercede for vengeance, and that the Author of this Epiſtle could condeſcend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the particular perſons againſt whom Chriſt intercedes, and that he intercedes againſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the Indulgence, becauſe of the complex of this deed of the Indulgence; yet this would make no diſcrepancy betwixt Chriſts Interceſſion in Heaven and Mr. <hi>Hutcheſons</hi> Speech upon earth; for except he proves that Chriſt intercedes for vengeance upon them, for their taking off the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil reſtraints of penal Statutes, and granting the peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry; all he ſays, is nothing to the purpoſe: For Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and the Indulged Miniſters did give thanks for this, and not for the complex of the Indulgence; for they never gave thanks for the Inſtructions. He will never prove that Chriſt as King, willeth the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of vengeance upon Magiſtrates, for tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off ſuch undue reſtraints; and much leſs will he be able to prove that Chriſt as Prieſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes by his blood for vengeance upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. And as for the Prayer which is in the end of Mr. <hi>Hutcheſons</hi> Speech, <hi>That the Lord would bleſs his Majeſty in his Perſon and Govenment, and their</hi> L. L. <hi>in the publick Adminiſtration;</hi> that was according to the Lords Command, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. where it is expreſly ſaid, That this praying for Kings, and all that are in Authority, <hi>is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour.</hi> And what they meant by his Majeſties Government, is
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40126:53" rendition="simple:additions"/> clear from what they ſaid before in the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Magiſtracy, which they deſign lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and the excellent Ordinance of God. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon</hi> ſpoke according to the good and acceptable will of the Lord, revealed in his word, this alledged diſcrepancy betwixt Chriſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion and their Speech, is one of the Authors roaveries, a Melancholy dream, with which he may affright himſelf; but the Indulged Miniſters are not ſuch weak Fools, as to be affrighted with his many terrible words of terrour, trembling, confuſion of face, ſhame and aſtoniſhment. This minds me of the cenſure which I ſaw of him in an Anſwer to the Hiſtory of the Indulgence, that he hath <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, paſſions without reaſon. The Indulged Miniſters believe, that they have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Lords will, in not ſlighting the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry, which the Lord in his good providence did offer to them; and they look upon the direction which they had from the Lord in this matter, to chuſe the good, and refuſe the ill; and upon the Lords aſſiſtance of them in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry, and his helping them hitherto, to run with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in the courſe of their Miniſtry, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the contradictions, and falſe reproaches they have met with from ſome, from whom they expected better things; and upon the bleſſing of the Lord in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry, as the fruits of Chriſts Interceſſion, ſo far are they from being confounded and terrified with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon the Interceſſion of Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:40126:54"/>
               <p>There are other things in this 3d. Queſtion, which may be denyed, at for example; <hi>That our Rulers in affronting Chriſt have outdone all that ever went before them, and were reſolved never to be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by any who ſhould come after them.</hi> What? no not by the Council at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who condemned him of Blaſphemy, and after commanded his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles not to ſpeak at all to any man in the name of Jeſus?</p>
               <p>But the Gentlemans obſervation holds here; for he goes as far as his fancy can go; he minds me of a Drunken man in the times of Popery, who could not get on upon his Horſe; at length, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving prayed to the <hi>Haly-rude of Crail</hi> to help him on, he went to ſome advantage, and did caſt himſelf over the Horſe, and then he blamed <hi>Haly-rude of Crail,</hi> becauſe it could not do, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it did over-do.</p>
               <p>I wiſh his ſtile were as ſolid and temperate as that Speech of Mr. <hi>Hutcheſons,</hi> which though he ſlightingly calls an <hi>Harangue</hi> yet was ſuch as did well become a Miniſter of the Goſpel; whereas this Author by a flood of great ſwelling words, is often carryed away beyond all bounds of Rime or Reaſon; but although they who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcern betwixt Words and Reaſon, may be toſſed to and fro with the windy noiſe of empty words; yet they who can diſcern the forcibleneſs of right words and ſolid arguings, from bold and imperious dictates and captious Queſtions, will not be moved with a Maſs of words, void of the Nerves of ſolid Reaſon.</p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:40126:54"/>
               <p>After his Queſtions, he very earneſtly deſires the Indulged Miniſters to relinquiſh the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations where they have the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry. To this Petition I give this ſhort anſwer: Theſe Miniſters think it their duty to preach in theſe Congregations, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore till he prove it to be their duty to relinquiſh them, he cannot expect that they ſhould grant his Petition. The reading of the following Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory which he recommends, hath been ſo far from ſhaking them, that they are more confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby; for his grounds are either ſo falſe, or ſo inconcludent of what he would infer from them againſt the Indulged Miniſters, that any who underſtand any thing of the rules of right reaſoning, are confirmed that the cauſe he hath taken in hand is evil; for if there had been good reaſons to have concluded againſt the Practice of the Indulged Miniſters, a man of his parts, and who had ſo much ſpare time to ſeek them out, could hardly have miſſed them.</p>
               <p>After this Petition and Advice to read the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, he ſaith, <hi>I am not without hope, but you will ſuffer your ſelves to be overcome into a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the humble and earneſt beſeechings, not of your poor Brother only, but of many who are preſenting you to God, and dare ſeek nothing for you till this be obtained; do not offend at this laſt word, for if it were my laſt, I muſt both confeſs unto you, I never had confidence to ſeek any thing for you, ſince you embraced the Indulgence, ſave this; and I know ſince that day, you have been out of the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of many ſerious Prayers, to whom you were and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40126:55" rendition="simple:additions"/> yet are dear, which hath been none of your advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; yea, whatever uſe you may make of it, yet fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to you, put me to uſe this freedom; that I have not only found my ſelf in fetters, but I have obſerved more fervent, judicious and gracious perſons, to whom it was a caſe of Conſcience; yea, who had no confidence to repreſent you to God, as a part of that ſuffering remnant for whom they aſſayed to pour out their heart before him; whereat you will ceaſe to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der when you conſider, that to them the Indulgence was defection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> If his Petition prevail not to draw the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Miniſters to relinquiſh what they have embraced; he eſſays to drive them from theſe Congregations where they exerciſe their Miniſtry, by a new kind of Excommunication; for till this, which he deſires be obtained, he ſhews that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and others dare ſeek nothing for them; if he had ſaid, that in their Prayers for the Indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they did in the firſt place ſeek, that they might relinquiſh what they had embraced, and then ſubjoyned other Petitions to that, it had been hard enough to have juſtified this Method and Order of praying, as the only right Method of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them; but that they dare ſeek nothing for them till they firſt relinquiſh what they have embraced, till his Petition to them be obtained, is a new piece of practical Divinity. I am ſure the Lords Prayer is not his Directory in this new Method of Praying, or rather of this new Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of reſtraining Prayer; is there no way of hallowing of the Name of God, and promoving of the coming of the Kingdom of God, and doing
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40126:55"/> the will of God which they are bound to by the command of God, till his Petition to them be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained? I think he will not ſay that their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in theſe charges, do make void the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the command of God; and if they be obliged to other duties (ſuppoſe this granting of his Petition to be a duty which it is not) even before this which he deſires be performed by them, why may he not pray for Grace to them, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to hallow the name of God, and do his will in theſe duties? May he not pray for daily bread for them, and that their ſins may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given them, and that they be not led into tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> May not a godly man dye without any doubt of the lawfulneſs of his exerciſing his Miniſtry in his own Pariſh, or in any other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute Congregation that invited him? May not a godly man dye in one, yea, in many errors that are not fundamental? Would this Author, if he were at the death of ſuch, refuſe to ſeek any thing for them, till they explicitely repent of theſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and actually quit them? I ſay explicitely; for every good man who hath true Repentance doth virtually and interpretatively repent of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of his ſins.</p>
               <p>This Author will have an actual relinquiſhing what they have embraced, before he ſeek any thing for them. Our Saviour prayed, that <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would forgive thoſe who were perſecuting him to death, and mocking him when on the Croſs. Stephen</hi> prays, That <hi>the Lord would not lay the ſin of thoſe who were ſtoning him, to their charge.</hi> Theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors were far from Repentance and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40126:56"/> when theſe prayers were put up for them.</p>
               <p>The Author acknowledges the Indulged to be godly men, and ſo he cannot deny that Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedes for them in Heaven; doth he think that the Interceſſion of Chriſt for them is interrupted, till that be obtained which the Author petitions? He knows that Chriſt intercedes for the Elect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they believe; for he prays for them who ſhall believe, that they may be one, <hi>&amp;c. Joh.</hi> 17.20, 21. If their unbelief doth not hinder his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, (for by his Death and Interceſſion they are brought to believe) doth he think that their miſcarriages after their Converſion, doth inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt his Interceſſion, and that he intercedes for nothing for them, till they actually reform what is wrong? I would deſire the Author and theſe perſons who take this method in this reſtraining Prayer, to think ſeriouſly how they can clear this method of theirs from a diſcord and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pancy with Chriſts Interceſſion; and if he hath not fallen into that fault, which he without juſt ground alledged againſt the Indulged Miniſters, What warrant he and theſe he ſpeaks of, have to caſt the Indulged Miniſters out of their Prayers, he and they would do well to examine; this is a new ſort of Excommunication, to caſt thoſe whom he acknowledges to be godly men, out of this part of the Communion of Saints. And I perceive by what he ſays, that this new cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is no warrantable cenſure; and proceeds not from that Authority which is given for edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and not for deſtruction; for even the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40126:56"/> ſentence of excommunication, is for the good and advantage, for the Salvation of the perſon excommunicated. But this new cenſure hath beeen, as he ſays, none of the advantage of the Indulged Miniſters. A cenſure that hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther effect but a non-advantage and damage of godly perſons; is no cenſure approven of Chriſt; for he hath commanded his ſervants and people, that they do all their things in love and for edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. How the Indulged Miniſters can be ſtill dear to thoſe who caſt them out of their Prayers to their damage, I cannot underſtand: I ſuppoſe when he and thoſe who take his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, have ſeriouſly reflected upon the matter, they will find that they themſelves have more diſadvantage by this uncharitable neglect of duty, than the Indulged Minſters have. He ſaith, he finds himſelf in fetters as to praying for them; ignorance, and prejudice, and humour, and ſuch like diſtempers, will fetter folk in duty; I am ſure his fetters are not made of the cords of love. I am very confident that more light and more love would looſe theſe fetters. If thoſe fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, judicious, gracious perſons that he ſpeaks of, were more judicious, and had more of the grace of charity, and had learned to love more fervently, they would not have fallen into that ignorant and uncharitable caſe of Conſcience, which binds them up from making Conſcience of praying for thoſe who are (as he ſays) dear unto them. If they had more judgment, and more fervent charity, they would pray much more better than they do; and when they pray
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40126:57"/> better, the Indulged Miniſters will not be caſt out of their Prayers. And I cannot but tell him, ſo long as he and they take ſuch unwarrantable and uncharitable methods of praying Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who are truly judicious, will not think ſo much of their Prayers, as it ſeems he and they do, who would terrifie the Indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters by their forbearing to pray for them, from the exerciſe of their Miniſtry in thoſe Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, in which through the good Providence of God, they have had in a ſad time the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able exerciſe thereof.</p>
               <p>That theſe people do not account the Indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Miniſters a part of the ſuffering remnant, is another of their miſtakes; for though their ſufferings have not run in the channel of the ſufferings of others, yet they have had their large ſhare in ſufferings, if the ſcourge of Tongues and Calumnies, back-bitings and heart-breaking reproaches be ſufferings, they may be reckoned among ſufferers. Theſe and many other ſad things they have endured with much patience; and theſe things they have ſuffered, becauſe they could not in Conſcience neglect to take the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>It's another of their miſtakes, that they look on the Indulged Miniſters as guilty of defection. They might have had patience till the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> had tried and found the practice of the Indulged Miniſters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: But at their own hand to condemn ſo many judicious and conſcientious Miniſters of defection, and caſt them out of their Prayers,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40126:57"/> are among the wild Practiſes of this evil time; in which many folk do what is right in their own eyes.</p>
               <p>But I perceive a new ſort of negative Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is like to come in faſhion in this Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Practical Divines condemn the ill-grounded confidence of thoſe who pleaſe themſelves becauſe they forbear groſs evils, though they neglect that which is good; and juſtly, becauſe <hi>the tree that brings not forth good fruit, is hewen down and caſt into the fire.</hi> But now many pleaſe themſelves as if they were more judicious, gracious, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than others, becauſe they forbear to hear the word of God preached by thoſe whom they dare not to deny to be Miniſters of the Goſpel, and becauſe they forſake the aſſemblies of the Lords People met together for the Lords worſhip; and becauſe they do not pray for thoſe who are dear to them, and whom they dare not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be godly, until they actually do that which they deſire them. O what need have we to walk humbly, and pray earneſtly for the Spirit of a ſound mind!</p>
               <p>He ſaith in that ſame page, <hi>That God hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten an Hiſtory againſt the Indulged Miniſters accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> I wiſh he had forborn this raſh aſſertion; the right order had been to have ſhewed that the practice of the Indulged Miniſters was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the written word of God; he knows that Providence is not our Bible. I know not what Hiſtory this is, and what theſe effects that he ſpeaks of, as flowing from the Indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters practice which he mentions elſewhere, are,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40126:58"/> and ſo cannot ſpeak particularly to them; if he meant that ſome have been very buſie to draw people away from hearing the Indulged Miniſters, he may remember that there were ſome who endeavoured to draw away the people from hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt himſelf. <hi>He is mad,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>why hear ye him?</hi> If he mean that ſome people who once countenanced their Miniſtry, have withdrawn from them, he knows that many of Chriſts Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples went back and walked no more with him; and they who would once have pulled out their eyes, and given them to <hi>Paul,</hi> looked on him as an enemy, becauſe he told them the truth; many have ſtumbled at Chriſt and the Goſpel, and the Miniſters of it, without cauſe. If he mean the renting and diviſion, that is no effect of the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Indulged Miniſters, but of thoſe who did ſet themſelves to draw the people off from them, and upon ſuch grounds that too many people are become very indifferent and careleſs of hearing any Miniſters, and ſome are only for hearing ſome few; and how long they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their reſpect for ſuch, who can tell? for it's the work of a ſpirit of Schiſm to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide and ſubdivide,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> uſed to ſay, that Providence was not our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and Mr. <hi>Ro. Blare</hi> uſed to call the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which the Engliſh u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpers took from ſucceſs, Turkiſh Arguments.</note> till all be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in ſhivers, and crumbled away to nothing. We ſhould be very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in ſpeaking of Gods written Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories againſt or for any thing. There are great myſteries in divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which does not appear, at firſt, till the Lords work be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40126:58"/> and all his Counſel appear; and therefore folk who are haſty in determining in this matter, run a great hazard of taking the Name of God in vain.</p>
               <p>In his next page he expreſſes ſome hope, that amongſt the Indulged themſelves, among ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny godly men, there were ſome that the Lord ſhould make uſe of to diſcover the evil of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence; and ſays, That that man ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> As for the evil that is in the complex of the Indulgence, ſeveral of the Indulged. Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have diſcovered it to much better purpoſe than the Author of the following Hiſtory hath done; but theſe ſame Miniſters have given ſuch ſolid Reaſons for the warrantableneſs of their own Practice in what they have done upon the Magiſtrates Indulgence, that he cannot in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon expect that they ſhould condemn themſelves in that, in which they have ſo much peace upon ſo ſolid grounds.</p>
               <p>In his laſt Section, he ſays, <hi>Many will cry out againſt the following Hiſtory (who ſhall never be able to anſwer its Reaſon, but by clamour) as unanſwerable.</hi> I anſwer, If he had been pleaſed to have read what the Indulged Miniſters and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have written in anſwer to what the Author of this Hiſtory ſent before this Hiſtory, in Letters and Queſtions, he might have ſeen any thing that this Author hath ſaid againſt the practiſe of the Indulged Miniſters, very rationally and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly anſwered. As for his firſt reaſon, for the ſeaſonableneſs of this, I anſwer, The evil which
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40126:59"/> is in the Magiſtrates actings, which relate to the Indulgence, have been more ſolidly diſcovered than this Author doth; but this Authors great deſign, is to faſten all the Magiſtrates faults in this matter, upon the Indulged Miniſters: And if this laſt be the Teſtimony which the Author means in his ſecond Reaſon, it's a falſe Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and of no value and worth, and worſe than nothing.</p>
               <p>In his third he is miſtaken; for ſeveral who are diſſatisfied with the Indulgence, are much more diſſatisfied with this Hiſtory, as a Book which they think will do much miſchief among ignorant and profane people, in hardning them in a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs neglect of the Lords Ordinances, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning of the Sabbath, and jumble many weak and well-meaning people, and confound them with things that they do not underſtand.</p>
               <p>His fourth Reaſon for the ſeaſonableneſs of it, is, becauſe the Indulged Brethren had been threatning and boaſting with a Vindication of the lawfulneſs of their acceptance. I anſwer, The Author either ſaw theſe Vindications, for there were many of them, or not; if he ſaw them not, might he not have had patience till he had ſeen what they had to ſay for themſelves? it was injuſtice to condemn men unheard, who were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering a Vindication of their Practice; but it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he had a mind to give them Couper Juſtice: But it may be he thought he could imagine all that they had to ſay; but this was raſhneſs, and too much ſelf-confidence; he ſhould have heard them, before he had anſwered, ſeeing he knew they
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40126:59" rendition="simple:additions"/> had ſpoken for themſelves. If he ſaw any of theſe Vindications, as ſome think he did, why did he not examine them? it may be he found them too hot for his handling: If he had ſent this Hiſtory to the Indulged Miniſters privately, that they might have given him a return, this had been fairly done; but to print it and publiſh it to the World at the very firſt, was not fair; <hi>non amice factum ab amico.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His firſt Reaſon for the ſeaſonableneſs of it, is, becauſe the Non-indulged Miniſters had done ſomewhat to ſtrengthen the hands of the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, by giving them new confidence in their courſe, <hi>in obliquo,</hi> covering all aid carrying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, as if they had done nothing amiſs, but upon the the matter, by a direct Homolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatry of the Indulgence; for now ſilence as to all ſpeaking againſt this evil, is made the very door and porch through which all entrance to the Miniſtry muſt paſs; <hi>And therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it's now ſimply neceſſary, and more than high time, to diſcover and detect the blackneſs of its Defection, when the Church is thus brought in bondage by it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I did not think that the Author, though he be very confident upon ſmall evidence, had ſo far paſſed the bounds of modeſty, as that he durſt in Print have avowed and juſtified the deed of two young men, who contrary to Presbyterian Principles, did ſet themſelves to counteract the judgment and ſentence of the ſuffering Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Church of <hi>Scotland;</hi> for their way did manifeſtly tend to the ſubverſion of the very foundation of all Government and Order.</p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:40126:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>It's a ſtrange Reaſon, that becauſe the Non indulged Miniſters endeavoured to ſtrengthen the hands of the Indulged Miniſters, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was ſeaſonable to put out a Book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning all together; and what elſe was this, but for two men living at a diſtance, to take upon them to condemn the whole Presbyterian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage two unruly youths in their contempt of any remnant of Authority, that that poor rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant had?</p>
               <p>What ſober perſon, who hath any Judgment in matters of that nature, can but commend the Practice of theſe Non-indulged Miniſters, who laboured to prevent the breaking of the Church, by that Queſtion about the Indulgence, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining theſe young men, who made it their great work to cry out againſt the Indulged Miniſters and the hearing of them? and yet this Author is ſo far from having that reverence that he ought to have had to the Judgment of the generality of the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that he thinks, becauſe they agreed together to endeavour to prevent the renting of the Church, therefore it was ſeaſonable to caſt in a new fire-ball of Contention among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſo render all their endeavours of Unity ineffectual; and what more effectual way would he have taken to render all the ſuffering Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> contemptible in the eyes of all who will believe him, than to charge all the Indulged Miniſters with ſo black and fearful a defection, and all the reſt of the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40126:60" rendition="simple:additions"/> Miniſters with a direct homologating of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence? In this he hath done ſervice very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to Prelatiſts, Papiſts, and Quakers, though I believe he deſigned no ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>His ſixth, taken from the ſevere inſulting over ſome of the poor remnant, who could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to witneſs their abhorrency of it, flows from miſinformation; the inſulting was among ſome of thoſe who quarrelled with the Indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and who took occaſion from the Indulged Miniſters forbearance to meddle with that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in their Sermons, to ſay, that they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay for themſelves; and thus their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence for peace ſake, was turned into a prejudice againſt them. They who live in theſe parts where Indulged Miniſters are, can bear witneſs how much forbearance and tenderneſs hath been uſed towards the poor people, who were confounded with theſe doubtful Diſputations, and frighted with unknown words of Homologations and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologatings, and impoſed upon by ſtrong al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgencies, and parables, and allegories, without Scripture or ſolid Reaſons.</p>
               <p>This way of witneſſing, which he means the withdrawing from the Lords Ordinances, to which they formerly reſorted, and in the uſe of which they profited, is a way of witneſſing, that if they who take it, have little cauſe to be aſhamed of it, as he ſays, I am ſure they have as little cauſe to glory in it; for there needs no more to qualifie folk for giving this Teſtimony, but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zineſs and groſs profanity, and contempt of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances. There can be no great matter in that,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40126:61"/> which any profane man, as he is profane, and becauſe he is profane, can do.</p>
               <p>As for his ſeventh, neither this Author, nor he, hath proven that the Indulged Miniſters entring into theſe Pariſhes, was a coming in, not by the door, but a climbing up another way.</p>
               <p>His laſt conſiſts of hopes, That ſome of theſe godly men Indulged, may be by this Hiſtory taken off, and that the Non-indulged will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how to deliver the Church from this evil, and their Brethren out of the ſnare, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from giving this evil any interpretatite coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; withal, that they will henceforth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more friendly towards the real Lovers of them and the Cauſe.</p>
               <p>It's needleſs to make any Anſwer to this: but that I ſee no appearance that this Hiſtory is like to take any of the Indulged Miniſters off; upon the contrary, there are ſo many falſe aſperſions and uncharitable wreſtlings, and ſo much bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that it makes even indifferent perſons ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his Cauſe bad, which is managed by ſo ill means and methods. As for thoſe lovers of the Non-indulged, and the Cauſe whom he deſigns, holders faſt of their integrity, in whom he ſeems afterwards to grant that there are exceſſes, he means, I ſuppoſe the young man of whom he ſpoke before, and if there be any other of his way.</p>
               <p>I like well of friendlineſs, and of ſhewing of all meekneſs to all men; but thoſe whom he ſeems to mean, have given no great evidence, that they are lovers of the cauſe, if by the cauſe he
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40126:61"/> mean Presbytery; for their way was directly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the way of Presbyterian Government; for they would not, and thought they ſhould not be ſubject to the Miniſters, and their work was to kindle the fire of Contention: if he and the Author of the Hiſtory had had as much charity for the Indulged Miniſters, as they had for thoſe young men, they would have found other names for their ſuppoſed faults, than blak defection, and betraying of the cauſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When all that he ſays of theſe young men, is, that they had exceſſes which are incident to the Zeal of the beſt Saints out of Heaven. He requires a juſt diſcountenancing of the defection of the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſters; but he ſays, theſe young men ought to be countenanced, cheriſhed and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged for their uprightneſs; and after real af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and tenderneſs witneſſed to them, then to procede to curb or cure their exceſſes. Curb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it ſeems, ſeemed too raſh a word; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he mollifies it by the alternative of curing. And yet I cannot underſtand how he comes to condeſcend to the cure of their exceſſes; for if I be not miſinformed, he and the Author of the Hiſtory, Commended them for theſe Practiſes, which were looked upon as their greateſt exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.<note place="margin">As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a confident aſſerting an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Call from God to preach upon a particular Text in a particular place, before any Invitation from the People or Miniſter.</note> But now I remember that one of them had ſome ſtrange Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Doctrine; it may be he hath heard ſome ſuch things which he deſigns exceſſes. I have been much longer detained in reviewing this
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40126:62" rendition="simple:additions"/> Epiſtle to the Reader than I deſigned; for I really deſigned to have made my Obſervation upon it no longer, if not ſhorter than the Epiſtle. I did not ſet my ſelf to ſeek out all that might have been excepted againſt, but only took notice of thoſe things which were obvious, and offered themſelves at firſt view.</p>
               <p>I thought my ſelf the more obliged to note thoſe obvious errors which I found in it, both for the peoples ſake; ſome whereof I hear read this book on the Lords day inſtead of the Bible; and for the Authors ſake, that he, if he ſhall ſee what is written, may ſee himſelf to be fallible; and that he may be better adviſed before he put ſuch Papers as this to the Preſs; and that he may know his own meaſure, and not look on himſelf as one fit to cenſure the generality of the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude his dictates upon them, when one of the unworthieſt of theſe Miniſters, who hath ſo little leiſure for ſuch work, hath in a haſty glancing through his Epiſtle, obſerved in a few pages ſo many dangerous Errata's in Doctrine, Worſhip, and Chriſtian Practice, and in Civil and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Government.</p>
               <p>I come now to the Hiſtory of the Indulgence. I have not ſo much leiſure as the Author of it had, and therefore I purpoſe not to follow him foot for foot; as that would be tedious, ſo it would be needleſs; ſeeing the Author ſerves us not only twice, but thrice with the ſame Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worts.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:40126:62"/>Occidit miſeros crambe repetita magiſtros.</q>
               <p>I looked for a ſtate of the Queſtion, but in vain. The true ſtate of the Queſtion, according to the mind of the Author of the Epiſtle, and the Author of the Hiſtory, is, <hi>Whether any Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or Permiſſion, though it were for every Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to return to his own charge, if granted by the preſent Magiſtrate, could be made uſe of?</hi> Both theſe Authors are for the negative: We heard the Author of the Epiſtle's mind before; the Author of the Hiſtory goes the ſame way, <hi>Pag.</hi> 121.5. <hi>If it ſhould be free of all theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intanglements, and grounds of ſcrupling; I leave it to Chriſtian Prudence to conſider, whether, as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters now ſtand, the Lord be not rather calling them to preach his Name on the Mountains, ſeeing this way hath been ſo ſignally bleſſed of the Lord, and is daily more countenanced of him, than their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring in their particular reſpective charges uſually have been: And ſeeing it's undeniable, that the Adverſaries are not yet really repenting of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Work of God, and therefore, that any ſuch permiſſion, if granted, could not be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to flow from any love to the proſperous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the Goſpel, but rather from the contrary, as is clear in the Indulgence already granted; and to flow from a purpoſe to entangle and enſnare, yea, and endanger both ſoul and body; if not from a purpoſe and deſign to deſtroy all at once.</hi> He hath a hint of it alſo, pag. 18. <hi>knowing that favours granted by ſtanding and ſtated enemies, could not
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40126:63"/> be for advantage, but for hurt. Anſ.</hi> I think it was well done, that he left the matter to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Prudence; but it was not to the purpoſe he deſigns, for ſeeing it was neceſſity that put prudent Miniſters and Chriſtians to the fields and mountains, becauſe they were there moſt free from hazard; I ſuppoſe the Chriſtian Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the one and other, would adviſe not to go to the fields and mountains, if the Magiſtrate granted ſo free a permiſſion as he there ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. And I know not if Miniſters and people could expect the Lords approbation and bleſſing, if needleſly they would claſh with the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in going to the mountains; for if Fathers ſhould not provoke their Children to wrath, then certainly Children and Subjects ſhould not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke their Parents and Rulers to wrath. His ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending of uſe-making of a liberty granted by the Magiſtrate, though free of entanglements, and ground of ſcruple upon the Magiſtrates real Repentance, and love to the proſperous progreſs of the Goſpel, is as unreaſonable as the Author of the Epiſtle his ſuſpending of his Prayers for the Indulged Miniſters till they quit their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and it ſavours ſtrongly of that error, That Dominion is founded in grace. May we take no favours from Magiſtrates, except they be real penitents, and have gracious Principles and good deſigns in their Magiſtratical actings? From what is ſaid, it appears, that though the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence had been free of clogs, yet theſe Authors would not have been for making uſe of it; they would ſtill have called the people to leave the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40126:63" rendition="simple:additions"/> Kirks, and come to the fields and mountains. They know that the Magiſtrate would oppoſe theſe Field-meetings; ſo that people may ſee, if they will follow the dictates of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, what ever favours our preſent Magiſtrates would give, and how free ſoever of ſuch clogs and entanglements as attended the Indulgence: yet they muſt go to the fields; and then ſeeing the Magiſtrate will ſend ſoldiers to diſſipate theſe Field-meetings, they muſt reſolve, if they cannot flee, to be carried to Priſons, or elſe to fight. This gratifies the deſigns of Papiſts exceedingly, who have been labouring ever ſince the Reformation, to put Magiſtrates and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in a ſtate-hoſtility and enmity one againſt another.</p>
               <p>Among many ſad things which have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied and followed this way, this hath been one, that the conceit many have entertained of fighting, hath exceedingly hindred their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation under the mighty hand of God, and ſo hath holden on, and encreaſed the Calamities and Deſolations of this poor Church.</p>
               <p>From what is obſerved out of the Writings of theſe Authors, Miniſters and People may ſee that no Indulgence given by the pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, will ſatisfie them; and that it is not a withdrawing from hearing the Indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that will ſatisfie them. Nothing leſs will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them, than a going to the mountains, and hearing thoſe who preach contrary to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates command; for there muſt be a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety in their acting to the Magiſtrate, or elſe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40126:64"/> it is not right; for this is put in the ſtate of the Queſtion in his Vindication of thoſe who ſcruple to hear and own the Indulged, <hi>Pag.</hi> 128, 129. for thoſe who are to be heard, are ſuch as preach not according to mans order, but contrary thereto. If there be not a contrariety to, and counteracting of the Magiſtrate, their Authors will not be ſatisfied, and no wonder; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than this will anſwer their deſign: ſo that people may ſee that their Authors, though they were out of danger themſelves, being at a good diſtance, and under an Engagement by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription with their hand not to come where the hazard was, yet they take upon them to draw up poor people, as it were in <hi>Battalia</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Rulers, and armed rude ſoldiers, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges them to hear any Propoſals from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, or to make any to him, or ſeek or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing from him; and now I leave it to be conſidered what this tends to. It was not becoming them, eſpecially who were without the reach of Musket-ſhot, to be ſo prodigal of the lives of poor people, as to think of no way of Peace, nor of any treating. I could not but remember what I had read in <hi>Terence</hi> of <hi>Thraſo,</hi> who kept himſelf far off from the hazard, and put others betwixt him and it; but he undertakes to give the ſign of Battel, <hi>Hic ego ero poſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipia inde omnibus ſignum dabo.</hi> And of <hi>Gnathos</hi> remark, <hi>Illuc eſt ſapere ut hos inſtruxit ipſius ſibi cavit loco:</hi> But People ſhould not upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of any man, ruſh themſelves upon hazards; when croſſes lies in the way that God calls
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40126:64"/> them to walk in, then they are their croſſes which the Lord calls them to take up willingly, and bear patiently; but they muſt not go out of the Lords way to ſeek croſſes; they will meet with as many as the Lord ſees meet for them in the Lords way. I cannot ſee how the preſcriptions that their Authors give to people, conſiſts with that command of of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.18. <hi>If it be poſſible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.</hi> I am ſure Rulers are not excluded, but in a ſpecial manner included in the Univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of all men.</p>
               <p>But I do not wonder, that the Author did not form the ſtate of the Queſtion diſtinctly; nor do I wonder, that they who are againſt the Indulged Miniſters, are generally againſt diſtinctions, at leaſt in that Queſtion; ſeeing that any apparent ſtrength that is in their arguings, is founded in confounding things that differ. If the Queſtion be rightly ſtated, as I ſtated it in the beginning, the Arguments commonly uſed againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, will be found not only inconcludent, but very ridiculous; for ſuppoſe the acts of the Magiſtrate indulging, to be wrong; and ſuppoſe the Indulged Miniſters to have miſcarried in their appearance before the Council; yet if ye but grant them to be Miniſters of the Goſpel, they might warrant to return to preach to their own Pariſhes, and deſtitute Congregations, might warrantably invite others of them who had not acceſs to their own Congregations, to help them in their deſtitute condition; and they might warrantably come upon their invitation to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40126:65"/> help them. To argue, it was unlawful to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite them, and for them to go upon that Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe the Magiſtrate appointed or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to go, or becauſe the Magiſtrate gave them Inſtructions, is very abſurd reaſoning; for this abſurdity follows upon it, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate may lay by any, yea, all the Miniſters of the Goſpel from exerciſing their Miniſtry, and render it ſinful to them to exerciſe their Miniſtry; for according to this way of reaſoning, he need do no more to bind up a Miniſter in his very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that he cannot preach without ſin, but appoint him or permit him to preach, and give him Inſtructions, and the work is done. He need not give pay to maintain ſoldiers to hinder preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with Swords and Guns, ſeeing he may do all that ſoldiers can do, and much more, by Pen, Ink and Paper: for ſoldiers can only impede them where they are preſent by external force; but theſe Paper-Ordinances reach their Conſciences, that they cannot preach without ſin in any place that he appoints or permits them to preach in.</p>
               <p>But there was thus much at leaſt of right in the Magiſtrates Indulgence, that it did ſo far relax that general reſtraint that was formerly laid by Penal Statutes upon Miniſters, that whereas before they could preach no where with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hazard, now they might ſomewhere have the publick exerciſe of their Miniſtry without hazard or diſturbance; ſo that it made way for the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry in ſome places; ſo that though the former Statutes were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogated, yet this derogating from ſuch Statutes,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40126:65"/> or this diſpenſation in taking away the Obligation of the Law, or the Obligation of a part of it, as to ſome perſons in reſpect of ſome place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

The moſt compendious way, if I be not miſtaken, to meet with any thing he ſays, is to conſider what is in his Arguments againſt the Indulgence; for he reſumes there what he had remarked on the Kings Letter; and what he hath in his Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, is taken out of theſe Arguments. In theſe Reaſons againſt the Indulgence, he ſaith, the Reader may ſee at one view, what was ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered up and down the foregoing Relation; ſo here we will find all his forces united and drawn up in order.</p>
               <p>Pag. 85. 1. He promiſes to ſhew in how many particulars, <hi>Injury was done by the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, as accepted, unto our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the only Head and King of his Church.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> That which the Indulged Miniſters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, was a freedom from, or a relaxation of that civil reſtraint which had hindered the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able exerciſe of their Miniſtry; as was cleared before. If he alledge that they accepted of the Inſtructions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is an acceptation of his own making, and he may make any thing, if he pleaſes; for the Indulged Miniſters cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any body to fight againſt their own fancies.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40126:66"/> having premiſed this, I come to the particulars of his charge againſt them.</p>

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40126:66" rendition="simple:additions"/> another Objection about holding the peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry from the Magiſtrate, he concludes; <hi>So that uſe what devices men can to cover this matter, a manifeſt betraying of the Cauſe will break through, and a receding from received and ſworn Principles, will be viſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the anſwer to the Informer, to which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he refers, he ſaith pag. 71. <hi>Miniſters receiving inſtructions for regulating them in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry from Magiſtrates, acting like themſelves Magiſterially and Architectonically, do, if not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, yet at leaſt virtually, deny Chriſt to be the only Head and Lawgiver of his Church.</hi> But again pag. 85. he objects, That <hi>this fault was but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal and accidental to the Indulgence, and ſo cannot effect the ſame, or make it an encroachment upon Chriſt of ſo high a nature. He anſwers,</hi> That being ſpoken at that occaſion, when the King and Council were acknowledged thankfully, for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Indulgence, and being ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>We declare that we hold not our Miniſtry of Chriſt alone, but of Chriſt and of the Magiſtrate; and therefore do accept of this Indulgence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſcruple. He adds afterward. Further this Diſcourſe of theirs ſo worded purpoſely and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately, ſaith, <hi>That if they had not believed that they held their Miniſtry not of Chriſt alone, but of others alſo, they could not have accepted of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is the Authors great Gun with which he thought fit to begin the battel; if this miſgive and do no skaith, there is no leſs reaſon to fear his leſſer Ordnance. It's ſtrange that he ſhould have begun with a piece of Ordnance, which he knows not whether it be fixed or not; he is not ſure whether the word <hi>only,</hi> was by ſome of the Indulged Miniſters deſired to be added; for when he ſays it, he caſts in this doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> If I be not miſinformed. He got many wrong Informations, and this may be one among the reſt.</p>
               <p>I do not remember of any ſuch thing; and if he be miſinformed, his firſt Argument hath neither matter nor form. I have heard it alledged that ſome people, by telling uncertainties, yea, falſhoods, come themſelves to believe them, and confidently to add to them. I find ſomething like this in this Author.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We ſee he ſpeaks doubtfully, if I be not miſinformed; but the oftener he repeats it, he grows the more poſitive and confident; for we never hear more of any doubt of his Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; yea, in repeating he wonderfully am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifies the matter, and makes the not ſaying of this only, to ſay many things; <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hereby they declared, that they did not hold their Miniſtry wholly and ſolely of Chriſt.</hi> He might have eaſily perceived, that a poſitive Declaration that they did not hold their Miniſtry from Chriſt only, is more than a not-ſaying, that they had it from him only. A man may truly ſay, I had this gift from my Father, though he add not the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive

                  </gap>is Father, and not from any other.</p>
               <p>Again, he granted that ſome of the Indulged deſired that the word <hi>only</hi> might be put in; ſure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>heſe did not poſitively and plainly refuſe to ſay, That they held their Miniſtry from Chriſt alone; and yet here he charges it upon the Indulged, generally, that they refuſed to ſay ſo. This is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of his Amplifications.</p>
               <p>Then he judgeth that this was a manifeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying of the Cauſe, and refers it to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world, if they carried as faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. What? ſhall Miniſters be condemned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>as not faithful, becauſe they ſpoke of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry in the words that the Holy Ghoſt taught <hi>Paul</hi> to ſpeak, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.24. Shall the uſing of the Words of God be judged a betraying of the cauſe of God? Suppoſe that that word was deſignedly and deliberately left out; this might have been the reaſon that they durſt not adventure to add a word to the words of the Apoſtle who ſpoke by the Inſpiration of God.</p>
               <p>He amplifies yet further, <hi>This was,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a giving up all to the Magiſtrate:</hi> That is a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful amplification. There is no mention made of the Magiſtrate in that ſentence at all, nor any giving of any thing to him there, but an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment that they had received their Miniſtry from Chriſt; and yet he will conclude, that by this all was given up to the Magiſtrate. What? was nothing given to Chriſt from whom they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40126:68"/> they had received their Miniſtry ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, and all given to the Magiſtrate, whom they do not ſo much as mention there? But he will prove that they gave up all to the Magiſtrate; <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hereby they declared, that in their judgment they had their Miniſtry from others as well as from Chriſt.</hi> Here he eats in again ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what he had ſaid; for even now all was given to the Magiſtrate; but here he leaves ſomething at leaſt to Chriſt, but takes in others with him; but who are theſe others? <hi>That is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Magiſtrate, as well as from Chriſt.</hi> What? was there no others but the Magiſtrate that they might have their Miniſtry from? I think he might rather have ſuppoſed that it was the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, than the Magiſtrate, eſpecially when he is ſpeaking of an equality; for it was an abominable alledgance of Blaſphemy to ſay, that they declared in their judgment that they had their Miniſtry from the Magiſtrate, as well as from Chriſt, and that in an Equality and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination; <hi>Or elſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that they had it not from Chriſt immediately, but from men; from the Magiſtrate in ſubordination to Chriſt:</hi> But were there no other men beſide the Magiſtrate? if he would have dealt candidly, he might have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that Presbyterians meaned rather the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery than the Magiſtrate; <hi>and therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>when they kept out the word</hi> only, <hi>they did plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare that they held their Miniſtry partly of the Magiſtrate,</hi> quod erat demonſtrandum. He is not ſure if this word was deſired to be put in; he knows not whether it was kept out upon
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40126:68"/> deſign; he knows not upon what deſign it was kept out; ſuppoſe it had been deſignedly kept out, and how then can he conclude from this, That theſe Miniſters declared, and that they plainly declared that they held their Miniſtry of the Magiſtrate? he may conclude any thing he pleaſes at this rate of reaſoning; yet I perceive he hath forgotten himſelf, as very ordinarily men who paſs the bounds of truth do, except they have very good memories; for a little before he alledged, all was given up to the Magiſtrate; but here he hath reduced him to a part: what is cited from pag. 71. relates to the inſtructions, which will come in afterwards.</p>
               <p>That the want of this <hi>only,</hi> was a perſonal fault, or was an encroachment upon Chriſt, or did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Indulgence, as he ſpeaks: he muſt prove he would make it a fault affecting the Indulgence, becauſe it was at that occaſion when the King and Council were thankfully acknowledged for the granting of the Indulgence, and becauſe it was ſpoken with underſtanding; but this hath no ſhew of Reaſon, if it be conſidered what it was they thankfully acknowledged, the freeing of them from the reſtraint which was upon the publick exerciſe of their Miniſtry; any who are not blinded with prejudice, may ſee that this was the deſign of theſe Presbyterian Miniſters to ſhew, that though they acknowledged the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates taking off that reſtraint, yet they did not look on themſelves as the Magiſtrates Miniſters, but as the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Miniſtry from him: But the thing

But, which is more ſtrange, he will not only have them to ſay as he ſays, but alſo believe as he alledges upom them; he will not only impoſe Charrangs upon them, but he will impoſe a Creed upon them; <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>this Diſcourſe of theirs ſaith, That if they had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that they held their Miniſtry not of Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but of others alſo, they could not have accepted of the Indulgence.</hi> I am ſure no judicious perſon who reads theſe things, will think that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any refutation; and I am very apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſuch will alledge, that I had little to do who tranſcribed them.</p>
               <p>When I was writing this, and reflecting upon the wild conceits that the Author hath fallen into upon this ſuppoſition, that <hi>only</hi> was purpoſely kept out, and that his amplifications grow ſtill the more remote from truth; it put me in mind of a cenſure which an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man paſſed upon a <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Gentleman with whom he was acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; this Gentleman told him ſtrange things which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> man could not believe, they were ſo leaſing-like: This <hi>Engliſh</hi> man having occaſion to ſpeak of this Gentleman, ſaid of him,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40126:69"/> 
                  <hi>He is,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>a very pretty Gentleman, but he amplifies mightily.</hi> This Author hath amplified mightily upon the word <hi>only;</hi> and if he had been profeſſedly making Romances, it had been more tolerable; but in a matter of ſo great importance to give his fancy leave to rove ſo as to condemn a Scripture-expreſſion made uſe of by the Indulged Miniſters, and to draw Treaſon againſt Chriſt, and a betraying of the Cauſe out of a Scripture ſentence uttered by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking by the Inſpiration of the Spirit; and not only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them for uſing the words that the Holy Ghoſt uſeth, but to impoſe words of his own, and a Creed of his own deviſing upon them; and then condemn them becauſe of that Faith and Profeſſion, is very intollerable inſolency.</p>
               <p>His Argument, if reduced to a form, muſt be to this purpoſe. <hi>Whoſoever deſignedly and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately declares that they have received their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry from the Lord Jeſus, and ſays not that they have not received their Miniſtry from Jeſus Christ only, they deny Christ to be alone head of his Church, and are guilty of High Treaſon againſt the King of kings, and betrayers of the Cauſe, and they ſet the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate in Chriſts Throne, and hold their Miniſtry of the Magiſtrate,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but ſo is it, the Indulged have deſignedly and deliberately declared,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> He is not ſure of the truth of the matter, for he brings in the Story, pag. 24. with that doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Parentheſis, <hi>if I be not miſinformed;</hi> many ſay, that it was the Authors mſhap that he was many times miſinformed; and its like this may be a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40126:70"/> piece of his bad intelligence: it's doubtful if it was refuſed by any of the Indulged Miniſters, to ſay they received, their Miniſtry from Chriſt only. The Author doubts of the truth of it himſelf, and I do not remember if ever I heard this before.</p>
               <p>But again, ſuppoſe it was refuſed, yet it was not refuſed by all the Indulged Miniſters, and yet he charges all indefinitely; it can be only charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the firſt ten who appeared before the Council, and not upon all theſe either; for he ſays, <hi>ſome of them deſired to have</hi> only <hi>put in,</hi> and ſo they did not refuſe. Yea, for any thing he hath ſaid, this Refuſal, if there were any ſuch thing, might have been only the Act of the Speaker; and yet from this Omiſſion or Refuſal to put in this word, which for any thing he ſays might have been the deed of one, he charges all the Indulged with High Treaſon againſt Chriſt, yea, he would have been at proving that this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion did affect the very Indulgence; and for any thing I can ſee, he would make this Omiſſion affect all after-Indulgences; for if the ſecond In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence be affected as well as the firſt, why not alſo a third, and <hi>ſic in infinitum.</hi> He amplifieth mightily when he ſpeaks of any ill or ſuppoſed ill in the Indulged Miniſters. The Magnifying-glaſs through which he hath looked upon the faults of the Indulged Miniſters, hath not been a true Glaſs; and there hath been no charity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed in its compoſition, but the vice which is oppoſite to that grace, hath been the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient in its compoſition.</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:40126:70"/>
               <p>But I come to his major Propoſition; and I ſhall ſo far gratifie him, though I'be not obliged to it, to give him leave to alledge that this <hi>only</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately left out. Yet I deny his Propoſition up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground, becauſe if it were true, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſpoke by the Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, when he ſaid <hi>he received his Miniſtry from the Lord Jeſus,</hi> would be chargeable with all theſe hideous things, which he charges on the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſters; for <hi>Paul</hi> put not in this excluſive particle <hi>only</hi> in his aſſertion, when he was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſame purpoſe which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of; and he ſpoke not raſhly but with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and deliberation, yea, by the inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt. If ye ſay, <hi>Paul</hi> did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to put it in; that's true, becauſe none did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to put it in; but I enquire, if the Author had been by him, and had deſired him to alter what he had ſpoken, that he might prevent the <hi>Eraſtian</hi> Error, whether he would have altered what he had ſaid? I ſuppoſe none will be ſo bold as to imagine he would have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the words of the Holy Ghoſt. Who dare take on them to teach God, who made mans mouth, how to ſpeak? If any were ſo bold as to alledge, that if <hi>Paul</hi> were to ſpeak this over again in theſe times, he would add <hi>only;</hi> he would be as ridiculous as that Miniſter was, who before the celebration of the Communion, told his Hearers, <hi>That they had hitherto received the Communion ſitting, but now they were to receive it kneeling; it's true,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Chriſt gave it ſitting, but I am ſure if he had given it again, he would have given it
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40126:71"/> kneeling.</hi> What the Spirit of God who knoweth all things paſt, preſent, and to come, ſpoke by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> he ſpoke it not only for that time, but for this; and except mens eyes be quite put out by prejudice, or ſome other diſtemper, they cannot imagine that words dited by the Spirit of Chriſt, are chargeable with theſe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid things which the Author would charge upon the Indulged Miniſters, who ſpoke as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke: Might not this be a very good Reaſon why Mr. <hi>H.</hi> might refuſe to put in the word <hi>only,</hi> becauſe he would not mend the Phraſe and Stile of the Holy Ghoſt?</p>
               <p n="2">2. But Mr. <hi>H.</hi> might think it fit to forbear to put in the excluſive Particle, to prevent the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny of thoſe who might readily have alledged that they pretended to an immediate call, ſuch as the Apoſtles had; for the words ſeem to ſound that way; and to add any word to the words of the Holy Ghoſt, which might be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into an occaſion of Calumny, had been, to ſay no more, great raſhneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon</hi> might have this Reaſon why he put not in the word <hi>only,</hi> becauſe Miniſters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Miniſtry not only from Chriſt, but alſo from the Father and the Holy Ghoſt; and it is one of the Arguments whereby Orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines prove the Deity of the Holy Ghoſt, againſt thoſe Hereticks who deny it, That the Holy Ghoſt is the Author and Inſtitutor of the Miniſtry, and cite that ſame Scripture which the Author hath cited, pag. 85. <hi>Hence,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they are ſaid to be made Overſeers by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Acts 20. v. 28. ſo
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:40126:71"/> that if he had but conſidered what he was writing, he might have ſeen a very good Reaſon why Mr. <hi>H.</hi> did keep out the excluſive Particle; and was not this a very good Reaſon why he might deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately leave it out, that he might not loſe an Argument for the Deity of the Holy Ghoſt? And <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1. The Father is joyned with Chriſt, <hi>Paul an Apoſtle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jeſus Chriſt and God the Father, who raiſed him from the dead.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 13.2, 4. <hi>he is ſeparated and ſent by the Holy Ghoſt to the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</hi> He might have remembred that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> was much better inſighted in Divinity, than he was, and might have had many Reaſons for forbearing this Addition, which he could not fall upon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If he had confeſſed his Ignorance, that he did not know upon what Reaſon or upon what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign Mr. <hi>H.</hi> had leſt this word out; this might have been ſpoken ingenuouſly; but to alledge that the deſign of this, was, to betray the Cauſe, and to eſtabliſh Eraſtianiſm, and to ſet the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate in Chriſts Throne, or put them in the room of the Presbytery, was a foul fault, which deſerves a worſe name than I will give it; and this fault is the more inexcuſable, becauſe there is not only no ground, nor appearance of ground in Mr. <hi>Hutcheſons</hi> Speech for it, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, any who will not ſhut their eyes may ſee that Mr. <hi>Hutcheſons</hi> deſign was to ſhew, that they had not their Miniſtry from the Magiſtrate, and that the Magiſtrate cannot order the Miniſtry or Miniſterial actings as he pleaſeth. For 1. the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſpeaks of, is that Miniſtry
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40126:72"/> which had, as to it's publick exerciſe, been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a civil reſtraint; now I ſuppoſe none will imagine that at their Ordination they received their Miniſtry from the Magiſtrate; for when they were Ordained, Presbytery was ſtanding, and no body imagined that their Miniſtry was received from the Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Author, pag. 87. reaſon right, when he ſhews that the receiving of the Miniſtry from the Magiſtrate, is inconſiſtent with the receiving of it from Chriſt, and is a plain dethroning of him. Then the receiving of the Miniſtry from Chriſt, is inconſiſtent with receiving it from the Civil Magiſtrate; and ſo when Mr. <hi>H.</hi> aſſerted that they had received their Miniſtry from Chriſt, he excluded the Magiſtrate from Chriſts Throne.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The receiving or deriving the Miniſtry from the Magiſtrate is an <hi>Eraſtian</hi> conceit, and none of the full Preſcriptions of Chriſt, but contrary thereunto, and therefore was excluded by Mr. <hi>Hutcheſons</hi> Speech, which aſſerts the fulneſs of Chriſts Preſcriptions for regulating the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whereas they declare their Reſolution in the diſcharge of their Miniſtry, to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as became faithful Miniſters of Chriſt: They ſhew that they were not the Magiſtrates Miniſters but Chriſts; and it had been inconſiſtent with faithfulneſs, to have derived their Miniſtry from the Magiſtrate, or to have ſubmitted their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry which they had from Chriſt, and which they were to exerciſe according to the Preſcriptions, as
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:40126:72"/> accountable to him, to the will and pleaſure of men; this had been a ſinful way of pleaſing men, inconſiſtent with faithfulneſs in the ſervice of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.10.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Their declaring of their continuance in their known Judgments, ſhews that they deſigned to let the Magiſtrate know that they were not <hi>Eraſtians,</hi> and that they minded not to put the Magiſtrate either in Chriſts Throne, or in the room of the Presbytery; for all who know Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians know that this is their Judgment, That it's Chriſt and not the Magiſtrate that is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Spiritual Power of the Church; and that it is not by the Magiſtrate but by the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, that Chriſt doth convey the Miniſterial Function to thoſe who are ordained.</p>
               <p>Now is not this ſtrange dealing, to alledge that Mr. <hi>Hutcheſons</hi> Speech gives the power of Chriſt, or the Presbytery, to the Magiſtrate, when there is not only no ground from Mr. <hi>Hutcheſons</hi> Speech for any ſuch alledgance, but many ſolid grounds demonſtrating the contrary? but this lets us ſee the imperious force of prejudice, which will have things to be as it will, without, yea, contrary to all Reaſon. After the writing of this, I was informed that this alledgance of the Author con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the word <hi>only,</hi> is utterly falſe, as all the Miniſters alive who were firſt Indulged will wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>In his 2, 3, 4. Sections pag. 86, and 87. he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers an alledgance, <hi>That the Indulged Miniſters accepted of the exerciſe of their Miniſtry from the Magiſtrate.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:40126:73"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Indulged Miniſters aſſert, That they have not only their Office or Authority, but alſo the exerciſe of it from Chriſt and not from the Magiſtrate; and if he had but conſidered the Scripture which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> made uſe of, he might have clearly ſeen, that the Miniſtry <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, comprehends the whole exerciſe of it; for he ſpeaks of finiſhing the Miniſtry which he had received from the Lord Jeſus. For any thing I know, the Author in theſe Sections, is fighting with his own ſhadow.</p>
               <p>In pag. 87. Sect. 5. he ſaith, <hi>The accepting of this Indulgence containeth another wrong done to Chriſt, in that thereby there is an acknowledgment made of the ſufficiency of all the Rules, Preſcriptions and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions granted by him for the ordering of the exerciſe of the Miniſtry—for in the Indulgence, Inſtructions were given—and when the Indulgence was imbraced, as accompanyed with theſe Inſtructions, the power granting theſe Inſtructions was acknowledged—and a granting of a Magiſterial Power to Magiſtrates to make ſuch Rules,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is a robbing of Chriſt of that ſole Supream Power which is due to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> If the Author had not Printed Mr. <hi>Hutcheſons</hi> Speech, and what the Miniſters who were called before the Council for not keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 29th. of <hi>May,</hi> ſpoke, it might have been thought he had never ſeen their Speeches.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>Hutcheſon</hi> declares the fulneſs of theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions; and yet this Author would have folk believe that the contrary was acknowledged, that theſe Rules were not full, but inſufficient; he ſuppoſes theſe Rules were received; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:40126:73"/> whereof was before cleared. It's a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable task to diſpute againſt a man who begs the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>His 6th. Section goes upon the ſame ſuppoſition, that they have taken their Miniſtry and Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The falſhood of both is cleared before. He refers us to what he ſaid in the Vindication of Mr. <hi>Blairs</hi> aſſertion. <hi>Anſ.</hi> If the Author had been as well diſpoſed towards the reſt of the Indulged Miniſters as he was to Mr. <hi>Blair,</hi> he would have vindicated them alſo, and not have been their accuſer; yea, ſo great is the force of truth, that it hath extorted a Vindication of them alſo from him; for he acknowledges that what Mr. <hi>Hutche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> ſpoke, was the ſame upon the matter with what Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> ſpoke; for ſpeaking of Mr. <hi>Hutche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> deſire to the Council, <hi>viz. That their</hi> L. L. <hi>would be pleaſed not to burthen them with impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the matter of their Miniſtry, wherein they were the ſervants of Chriſt.</hi> He ſays, he is apt to think that this deſire did import, that he and the reſt were unclear to ſubmit unto impoſitions in the matter of their Miniſtry, becauſe of their being the Servants of Chriſt; and then he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns that Queſtion, Why were the Brethren ſo offended with what Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> ſaid? which ſhews that Mr. <hi>Hutcheſons</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blairs</hi> words were to the ſame purpoſe.

Theſe qualifications were in none of the acts of Indulgence; they were not intimate to the Miniſters, much leſs were theſe Miniſters interrogate, if they had lived peaceably and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly: And as for the Kings Letter, I believe many Indulged Miniſters never ſaw it, till the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40126:75"/> Author printed it; yea, ſome who have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter intelligence than the Author had, doubt if ever any Presbyterians ſaw the Kings Letter, or a true Copy of it, or if there be a true Copy of it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; the Council did not publiſh the Kings Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te; and to quarrel openly at a Clauſe in the Kings Letter directed to the ſecret Council, not publiſhed to them, and whereof they had no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Copy upon which they could found their Plea, would have evidenced too great an Itch of quarrelling with the King.</p>
               <p>I ſee it's very hard to pleaſe ſome folk when they are angry; if the Magiſtrate had deſigned the Author unpeaceable and diſorderly, he would have judged himſelf injured; and if he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned him peaceable and orderly, he would have counted it a reproach; and yet it would ſeem ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, he ſhould have been pleaſed either with the one or the other. If he look upon it as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to be called unpeaceable, why ſhould be think that which is oppoſite to that injury to be evil? I think he is miſtaken in the explication of theſe terms. I do not well underſtand a negative compliance; for compliance ſeems to import ſomething poſitive; and a negative poſitive thing, is a thing odly compoſed.</p>
               <p>I know no outed Miniſter who can fall under the deſcription that he gives of peaceable and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly living, ſeeing their very Nonconformity is a tranſgreſſion of the Laws, and ſo diſpleaſing to the Makers of theſe Laws; and to alledge that any of them were ſilent, as to the bearing faithful witneſs to the cauſe of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is no ſmall injury
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40126:75" rendition="simple:additions"/> done to them. I ſuppoſe it was not the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates deſign to ſet down Miniſterial qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to determine that theſe too, are the qualifications only requiſite in a Miniſter; to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that peaceableneſs and orderlineſs, which every Magiſtrate in the world requires of every Subject, were made Miniſterial qualifications, and the only Miniſterial qualifications by our Rulers, is an alledgance that hath no colour, no ſhew, no ſhadow of probability. Nor do I think that it was the deſign of the Magiſtrate to exclude Presbyterians for preaching againſt Prelacy, or for Presbytery, or for the obligation of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. I do not remember that they have put any to the trouble for Doctrine of that nature. But I conceive their deſign being to keep the Country peaceable they had no mind that any Miniſters who would ſtir up the people to fight againſt them, ſhould be ſettled in Kirks; and in this they are not ſingular: For I ſuppoſe all the Magiſtrates in the World are of the ſame mind. Now he knows that the Apoſtles and primitive Chriſtians lived peaceably enough in this ſenſe in reference to the Heathen Emperors.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But grant that the Magiſtrate had deſigned theſe for Miniſterial qualifications, and grant that theſe qualifications were as ill as he makes them; he hath no ſhadow of Reaſon to prove that the Indulged Miniſters did approve of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates taking on him to appoint qualifications, or that they owned themſelves to be ſuch and ſuch, as the Magiſtrate deſigned; for as I ſaid, theſe qualifications were not intimate to them; and though they had been intimate, what Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:40126:76"/> ſpoke was ſufficient to caſt all qualifications that were not right; for Miniſters muſt be qualified ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſts preſcription; and he ſumm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed up their qualifications in Prudency and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And it's the known Judgment of Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that it's the work of Chriſt, and not of the Magiſtrate, to inſtitute the Miniſtry, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the qualifications of Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Pag. 88. Sect. 8. He alledges, <hi>That the Indulged are not ſet over theſe flocks by the Holy Ghoſt, but by the King and the Council; and for thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their former charges,</hi> he ſays, <hi>their ground of returning is not their former relation unto that people, but the Order of the Council.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Theſe are falſe alledgances, and as eaſily denied by the Indulged Miniſters, as affirmed by him. The former relation was the ground of theſe Miniſters returning to their former charges; it was really a juſt ground of returning; and they who returned, did go upon this ground in return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the Councils Act did not weaken this ground, but made way for their peaceable acceſs to the exerciſe of their Miniſtry, where they had ſo juſt ground to exerciſe it. I wonder how he could obtrude his groundleſs alledgances, and put his groundleſs ſayings in the mouths of the Indulged Miniſters; for he ſaith, <hi>That the Miniſter can only now ſay, Though this be the Flock over which the Holy Ghoſt did once make me Overſeer, yet now I am ſet over it by the Councils Order.</hi> It's ſtrange that he will not content himſelf to ſpeak what he pleaſes without reaſon, but he will have the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Miniſters to ſpeak as he pleaſes, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their own knowledge and ſolid reaſon; but
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40126:76"/> they who will ſpeak without reaſon, muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and make where they want.</p>
               <p>He ſays, <hi>That the cordial invitation, which ſome poſſibly did obtain, was no ſuch call as Chriſts law alloweth; it was not the Riſe and Fountain of theſe Miniſters going to theſe places, but a poſterior meer precarious thing; whereby the Ordinance of Chriſt was rather proſtituted than followed. It's ſufficienly known, the Council made the free Election, and not the Pariſh; and withal, where was the Act of the Presbytery, giving them Miniſterially a poteſtative miſſion. The Council both called, chooſed, and ſent, and ſo were both the flocks and Presbytery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> He ſtill playeth the Dictator; and what he ſhould prove, he alledgeth, that it is ſufficienly known. It's well known that there could be no acceſs to the peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry without the Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Miniſters could not preſcribe to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil when they ſhould make their Acts of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; had it been fit for them to have deſired the Council to make no Acts in reference to any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, until the Election of the Pariſh and the Act of the Presbytery had gone before? the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries were diſſolved, and to quarrel that there was no Presbyteries, is but to quarrel againſt the holy Providence of God, who had deprived us of theſe Courts; and to have declared that they would not have the Council make any ſuch Act, till Presbyteries were again ſetled, would have been to have refuſed any thing from the Council, except they would give all; and this as matters then ſtood, had been a refuſal of any thing
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40126:77"/> from the Magiſtrate; this had been very ſutable to the deſign of the Author, and the Author of the <hi>Epiſtle to the Reader,</hi> and <hi>Cup of cold Water,</hi> who are for receiving nothing from the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. But when it's exeamined by reaſon, it will be found to be nothing but unreaſonable humor. That the Councils Act which made way for the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry in ſuch places, went before the peoples invitation, flowed from the Councils pleaſure, which was not in the power of the Indulged Miniſters. But after the Council had paſſed their Act, it was in the power of the Pariſhes to have invited there Miniſters, or not to have invited them, as they ſaw fit.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Thomas Wylie</hi> hath in that Paper which he emitted for Vindication of the Indulged Miniſters, cleared the freedom of the peoples invitation; it was in their power to have invited, or to have forborn to invite; and though they had forborn to invite; they would have been but in the condition they were formerly in. And it was in the power of theſe Miniſters in theſe bounds, to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented or not conſented to the invitation of the Pariſhes; and it was in the power of the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſters, when they ſaw the Invitation of the people, to have gone, or not to have gone to theſe Pariſhes, as they ſaw reaſon; for though the Councils Act made way for their going, yet it did not ſettle them in theſe Pariſhes, nor make any relation betwixt them and there Pariſhes.</p>
               <p>Now when it is conſidered that all Miniſters are Miniſters of the Church Univerſal, and in a ſpecial manner of the National Church, in which
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40126:77"/> they were ordained Miniſters, and many exerciſe their Miniſterial Offices in other Congregations than thoſe where they were ordained (as Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians maintain againſt Independents) if there be no juſt Impediment, nor wrong done to any by the exerciſe of their Miniſtry; and that theſe Congregations who invited them, were deſtitute, and earneſtly deſired their help; and that the Miniſters of theſe bounds conſented, or acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſced to the peoples inviting them, and their coming upon the peoples invitation. When theſe things are conſidered, I ſuppoſe every judicious unperjudiced perſon, will acknowledge that theſe Miniſters had a ſufficient call to help theſe deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute people, who earneſtly deſired their help un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they might have regreſs to their own Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations where they were ordained Miniſters.</p>
               <p>He ſaw that if the call of the Indulged Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters were queſtioned, then the call of theſe who preach in the Fields would be queſtioned alſo; therefore having moved that queſtion, What ſhall then be ſaid of them, who preach in the Fields? pag. 89. Sect. 3. he anſwers, <hi>Every one may ſee how impertinent this queſtion is; for this preaching in the Fields or Houſes is no fixed ſtated overſight over a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct company, as is that of a Miniſter over a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar flock, but a meer occaſional act, depending upon a providential Call from God, and the cordial intreaty of this perſecuted people, which is all that is requiſite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Anſ.</hi> This is a piece of art in ſome Diſputers, to ſlight that as clearly impertinent which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not anſwer; there is no doubt of a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt fixed and occaſional Preaching: for a fixed
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:40126:78"/> ſtated preaching hath many advantages which an ambulatory &amp; occaſional preaching wants; but the queſtion is, whether they who preach in the Fields be called of God to preach, and to take as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection as they can for that occaſion, of the peoples caſe to whom they preach; and if their call be good, as I hope he will not deny, the call of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Miniſters muſt be good alſo; For the Indulged had a more deliberate Invitation and intreaty than theſe Preachers ordinarily can have; and a more general invitation from theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, than theſe Preachers have, or can wait for: And the Miniſters of the bounds knew of the invitation given to the Indulged Miniſters a conſiderable time before they came; ſo that if they had been diſpoſed to have excepted againſt it, they had opportunity to have acquainted the people, or the Indulged Miniſter, with their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions: but theſe occaſional Preachers are often come and gone before Miniſters concerned in theſe bounds hear any thing of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if the one be good, the other cannot be evil.</p>
               <p>The fixedneſs of the Indulged Miniſters makes not their call bad. I ſuppoſe thoſe people did intreat one of theſe who preaches in the Fields to ſtay with them, and take inſpetcion of them as long as he could with ſafety; would his continuing to labour among them, make his Call, which was at firſt good, become bad afterwards? if it was good the firſt time he preached, why ſhould it be ill the next? if he may preach for a month, why not for a year? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The term of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:40126:78" rendition="simple:additions"/> a providential Call, is a kittle word; and ſome have ſaid, That only Providential Miniſters are the Miniſters that ſhould be heard. We had need to beware of new words in a time when folk are ſo much addicted to Novelties; ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily new words are big with Novelties, new Conceits and new things: how he would define a Providential Call, I know not; but if that be the thing he means, That the Lord in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence makes way for, and gives an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of occaſional Preaching; then it may be ſaid, that the Lord in his Providence made way by what the Magiſtrate did, for the peaceable exerciſe of the Indulged Miniſters Miniſtry in the Congregations where they are ſetled. I ſhall ſay no more of this, but for any thing I can ſee, if this Author be believed, neither Presbyterians that preach fixedly, nor theſe who preach oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally, can ſay, that their Miniſterial over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight or inſpection is by the Holy Ghoſt; for he affirms this of the Indulged, and does not think it requiſite in thoſe who preach occaſionally; and of how dangerous conſequence this is, I leave it to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>Pag. 89. Sect. 9. His 9. Section is concerning the Inſtructions, of which enough hath been ſaid before. The Indulged Miniſters accepted of the relaxation, as before explained, but did not accept of the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. In the ſame page he ſaith in anſwer to an objection, <hi>That there could be no ſimple uſe-making of that ſuppoſed favour, ſo attended with impoſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, without a virtual acknowledgment of a right and power in the Magiſtrate to make and impoſe
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:40126:79"/> ſuch conditions; for howbeit the Council propoſe the matters by way of command, yet both the nature of the thing, and the Concomitant acts to reſtrict, &amp;c. ſay that the accepting of the firſt is with an engagement to perform the ſecond, both being but one complex thing</hi>—Then he adds; <hi>That the Council held forth the favour to be granted and accepted condition-ways. And Mr.</hi> A. Blair <hi>for the renouncing of the condition, was deprived of the favour; he who taketh a favour offered with burdens, takes the favour</hi> cum onere; <hi>as when a Father grants ſuch a piece of Land to his Son, but withal layeth on the burthen of paying ſo much debt; if the Son ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth the Land, he cannot but take on the debt, though he gave no expreſs conſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> That there could be no ſimple uſe-mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the freedom from reſtraint, as before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, without the acknowledgment that he ſpeaks of, is one of his dictates. The taking off the reſtraint was good, the laying of reſtrictions was ill; are good and ill ſo inſeparable that we cannot chuſe what is good, and refuſe what is evil?</p>
               <p>The nature of the thing ſays no ſuch thing as he alledges. It's no wonder this Author makes the Indulged Miniſters ſpeak his Imaginations, when he makes the nature of things ſpeak any thing that he pleaſeth; then to make all ſure, he makes the taking off the reſtraint, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of reſtrictions, to be one complex thing; for he can make two things, though the one be good, and the other evil, to be one thing; but this Compoſition is in his own Phanſie. I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant he can make one thing two: the force of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:40126:79" rendition="simple:additions"/> Imagination will do, they ſay, great feats upon the perſon in whom the Imagination is: but I hope his Imagination cannot change the nature of things without him, as to turn two things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one, or one thing into two. I am confident the Councellors will not ſay, That the Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were accepted by the Indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; what words might be ſlipped in Papers, I will not ſay; and what wonder if ſome Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick perſon did alledge that, and get it in a Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed paper, when a young man when he ſhould have been preaching, ſaid, <hi>That the Indulged Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters had given in Bands to the Council.</hi> If Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> refuſed the Conditions, ſo did Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon;</hi> and if Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon</hi> had been impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, his Teſtimony would have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; for this was the difference: for as to what they ſaid, the Author acknowledges that it was the ſame thing upon the matter; but nothing in Miniſters carriage will pleaſe ſome folk, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it anger, and ſo anger the Magiſtrate, that the Miniſter be put to ſuffer, or elſe into a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of War.</p>
               <p>His ſimilitude is but a ſimilitude; and although Allegories and Compariſons paſs for good proofs among common people, yet he knows that ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes illuſtrate a thing, but do not prove it. A Father who granteth his Son a piece of Land, might have given it to another, and hath power to oblige his Son who gets his Land, to pay his debt; and it's reaſonable that a mans debts ſhould be payed by him who gets his Land; but if the Father ſhould grant his Land to his Son,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40126:80"/> and enjoyn ſomething to his Son that he could not oblige his Son to do, as being ſomething that the Father had not power to preſcribe, or ſomething not right, or which the Son could not in conſcience obſerve; if the Son ſhould accept of the Fathers grant, and withal tell him that he could not receive ſuch Preſcriptions, and that his Father could not impoſe ſuch things upon him, or that he had received full Preſcriptions from one Superior both to his Father and him, which he behoved to keep upon his greateſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril, without adding to them, or diminiſhing from them; or that in theſe matters which his Father preſcribed, he was not at his own diſpoſal, being ſervant to another in things of that nature. None could ſay in that caſe that the Son was obliged to the Conditions his Father required.</p>
               <p>Now the Indulged Miniſters did ſhew that they had received full Preſcriptions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that the Magiſtrate had not a power formally Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical; and that in the matters of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, they were the Servants of Chriſt; but enough of this before.</p>
               <p>Yea, I ſuppoſe in ſome caſes ſilence will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port no conſent nor acceptance. Suppoſe one who hath by ſtrong hand bound a man who ought not to have been bound, and tells him he will looſe him, and withal when he is looſing him, he commands him to do ſomething which he hath no power to command, nor can the man in conſcience perform; will any ſay, that becauſe the poor man holds his tongue, that therefore he hath accepted the Condition? I ſee no reaſon
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40126:80"/> for this; for as a man is not obliged at all times to profeſs what he believes, as is clear in that caſe commonly alledged; If a mad furious man with a drawn Sword in his hand, would cry, Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever profeſſes himſelf to believe the Goſpel, I will kill him; no Caſuiſt determines that a Chriſtian is to proſeſs his faith in the hearing of that furious man; ſo a man is not always bound to profeſs what he will do, or not do; as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one who hath unjuſtly bound a man, comes and looſes him to do ſomething which the man that is looſed hath no mind to perform; is he obliged in all caſes to tell that he will not do what he commands, when the telling of it will in all appearance provoke the other to keep him ſtill in bonds? He who gets an Eſtate from one who owed him nothing, and a Command withall to pay his debt, ſeems to be in juſtice bound to pay that debt, though he ſpeak not. Again, he who gets a favour from another, which the giver was not bound to give, and withal a deſire to do ſomething for his Benefactor, if the thing deſired be not prejudicial to the man who received the favour, or if he be as much advantaged by the favour ſhewed to him, as he can be prejudiced by the doing of that which his Benefactor deſired; it ſeems that he is in point of gratitude bound to do it: But when one who hath done an injury to another in binding him, looſes him and commands him to do ſomething lawful, though the man hold his peace, I do not ſee how he is bound even to that lawful thing; becauſe the man that looſes him, is bound to do
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40126:81"/> him that right whom he had wronged before; and beſides, is obliged to make reparation for the wrong done: but much leſs could he be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by his ſilence, or could his ſilence be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted to be a conſent to it. But the Indulged Miniſters need not this Anſwer, for they witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a good Confeſſion before the Rulers. If he had formed his ſimilitude thus, A Father reſtrains his Son from ſome external duty in Religion, which the Son is called to of God, and when he takes off the reſtraint, takes upon him to give Rules of worſhipping God to his Son, which the Lord hath not given; the ſimilitude would have been more to the purpoſe: And if the Son had accepted of the freedom from the former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, and withal, had told his Father he had full Preſcriptions from God how to worſhip, and that the matters of Divine worſhip are not to be ordered by the will and pleaſure of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, but by the Will of God; none would imagine that the Son had accepted of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.</p>
               <p>Pag. 90. He undertakes to ſhew how contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the acceptance of the Indulgence is to Presbyterian Principles. If he would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted againſt what the Indulged Miniſters did, he ſhould have diſputed againſt their uſe-making of the relaxation of the civil reſtraint, as was ſaid before. But he ſtill miſtakes the queſtion, and plays in the general confuſed words of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of the Indulgence. <hi>Veterator ludit in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralibus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He hath waſted much time and Paper in vain,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:40126:81" rendition="simple:additions"/> in fighting againſt an imaginary accepting of the Indulgence, which is a man of ſtraw of his own making, and he may uſe it as he pleaſeth. We have already ſpoken of the qualifications which he ſpeaks of in his firſt Section, and are not to weary our ſelves or the Reader with needleſs Repetitions.</p>
               <p>In that ſame pag. Sect. 2. He alledgeth, <hi>That the Magiſtrate did all which belongs to Church Judicatories in conveying Miniſterially the Office and Power to perſons qualified, and in granting a poteſtative miſſion in ſending the Indulged to ſuch and ſuch places, and that the Council only clothed them with Authority for that effect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> 1. Theſe are ſtill his own fancies and dictates; for he cannot prove from the words that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil uſed, that they did aſſume any ſuch thing as a Power of poteſtative miſſion. In the firſt Indulgence they appoint Miniſters to preach and exerciſe the other Functions of the Miniſtry at ſuch and ſuch Kirks, as he relates, pag. 19. In the ſecond Indulgence they appoint the Miniſters to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to ſuch and ſuch Pariſhes, and to remain therein confined, permitting and allowing them to preach and exerciſe the other parts of their Miniſterial Function in the Pariſhes to which they are confined.</p>
               <p>Now the words of appointing, allowing, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to preach, import no poteſtative miſſion. The Magiſtrate may in ſome caſes not only permit, allow, appoint, but compel Miniſters to preach; yea, they may place them, which is much more than appointing them to preach:

               <p>Mr. <hi>Welſh</hi> by the Kings ſending, doth not mean a poteſtative Miſſion; he underſtood himſelf better than ſo: He knew the King could not ordain Miniſters; but the Kings ſending, is his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his appointing Miniſters to go and preach throughout the Kingdom; but if the Council in the Acts of Indulgence, had made uſe of the word of <hi>ſending,</hi> and other words in the Books of Diſcipline; O what out-crying would ſome folk have made, ſeeing they make the ſimple words of <hi>appointing</hi> and <hi>permitting</hi> to be no leſs than a poteſtative Miſſion; which is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt abuſe and perverting of Words!</p>

And yet though they make Kings and Emperours meer Servants to the Pope and Biſhops, implicitely and blindly to execute their Decrees; yet they grant that the Magiſtrate may apply the Church-men to the uſe and exerciſe of their Office; yea, even the Jeſuits who are moſt addicted to the Pope, grant this, as <hi>Becanus</hi> the Jeſuit in his <hi>Manual of Controverſies of the Time,</hi> Book 5. Chap. 19. pag. 746. and withal ſhews, that this is the common uſe among them, <hi>&amp; hoc paſſim apud Catholicos in uſu eſt.</hi> From what hath been cited from the Books of Diſcipline, we may ſee that the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> did not look upon the Magiſtrates appointing, and much leſs on their permitting Miniſters to preach, as a poteſtative miſſion, or as any part of the power of the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
               <p>The Author of the Hiſtory of the Indulgence, mentions not, that I remember, what I have cited out of the firſt Book of Diſcipline; he only, pag. 116. objects in the 3d. objection what is cited out of the the ſecond Book of Diſcipline, Chap. 10. concerning Magiſtrates placing of Miniſters, when the Kirk is corrupted, and all things are out of order; and he anſwers, <hi>That in ſuch times Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates may do much more than at other times; yet,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I ſuppoſe none for ſhame can make uſe of ſuch a Conceſſion now.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſuſpect the Author hath been gravelled and pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with this Objection; and therefore he would ſhuffe it off with ſcorn and diſdain: but this is a piece of Art in ſome to ſeem to make nothing
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:40126:84"/> of theſe objections to which they ſee they can give no ſatisfactory anſwer; but when any will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paſſion conſider this paſſage in the ſecond Book of Diſcipline, they will ſee that the placing of Miniſters implies more than permitting them or appointing them to preach; for though the Magiſtrate appoint a Miniſter to preach in ſuch a Pariſh, if the Pariſh do not invite him, or if the Invitation be not ſatisfactory to the Miniſter, he may forbear to go to that Pariſh to preach; but when a Miniſter is placed, he is actually ſetled in a Pariſh; and therefore the Book of Diſcipline allows of the Magiſtrates doing more than permitting and appointing Miniſters to preach.</p>
               <p>Again, it appears from this, That the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates permitting or appointing Miniſters to preach in a Pariſh, is not in the Judgment of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> contrary to Presbyterian Principles; for the Authors of the ſecond Book of Diſcipline, and the General Aſſembly of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who examined that Book ſo carefully, and appointed all the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> to ſubſcribe it, underſtood what were the Principles of Presbyterian Government, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than this Author did: And theſe great Seers did ſee no <hi>abomination of deſolation</hi> in Magiſtrates placing Miniſters; and much leſs did they, or could they ſee it in their permitting them or appointing them to preach when the Church is corrupted, and all things out of order; but why thinks he, that none can for ſhame make uſe of that Conceſſion now? He gives this Reaſon; <hi>See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:40126:85"/> ſays he, <hi>our Church was conſtituted and well ordered, and had all her Rights and Privlledges.</hi> But I wonder that he for ſhame could make uſe of this anſwer. If he could have ſaid, Seeing our Church is conſtituted and well ordered, and hath all her Rights, it had been a pertinent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, if it had been true; but when he ſays, <hi>only our Church was conſtituted and well ordered, and had all her Rights,</hi> he grants that the Church now is not conſtituted nor ordered, nor hath not her Rights; he clearly yields the cauſe, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that our Church is in ſuch a caſe, as that is of which the ſecond Book of Diſcipline ſpeaks. He might have conſidered that the Readers of his Book would be very ſenſleſs if they could not ſee a difference betwixt what once was, and what now is; but this was good enough to put off ſimple people who cannot diſtinguiſh betwixt wat is paſt, and what is preſent. But he adds, <hi>When the Magiſtrates with their own hands have overturned all, ſhall this Objection be made uſe of to countenance their after-practiſes? that were indeed to teach Magiſtrates a way how to uſurp, and take to themſelves all Church-power,</hi> viz. <hi>let them once by Iniquity and Tyranny break the glorious Order of the Church, and bring all into Confuſion, and then forſooth, they may warrantably aſſume to themſelves an exerciſe all Church-power according to their mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> He ſeems to inſinuate, that the ſecond Book of Diſcipline yields, that the Magiſtrate may aſſume all Church-power, which is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation very injurious to the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:40126:85"/> In that ſame page cited from Chap. 10. of the ſecond Book of Diſcipline, they ſhew that the Magiſtrate may not uſurp the power of the ſpiritual Keys.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He might have learned from Mr. <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> that the Magiſtratical power which capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citates the Magiſtrate to do good to the Church, is the ſame in ill Magiſtrates, even in a <hi>Nero,</hi> that it is in good Magiſtrates.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The more ill the Magiſtrate hath done to the Church, he is more bound to repair the wrong he hath done.</p>
               <p n="4">4. According to this way of Reaſoning, if the Magiſtrate overturn the Church; he can do no more good to the Church; if the placing of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in the corrupted ſtate of the Church, be commendable in godly Magiſtrates, why would he hinder Magiſtrates which have overrurned all, to reſtore all or a part, to do ſomething that is good? or why ſhould that be counted Uſurpation in them, which is commended as good ſervice done to the Church, when it is done by godly Emperours and Kings? Is not that the duty of theſe who have overturned the Order of the Church, to build what they have deſtroyed? and when they do any thing that way, it ſhould not be deſpiſed, but made uſe of, as far as can be done with a good Conſcience?</p>
               <p>But the Indulged Miniſters need not anxiouſly enquire (as to the defence of their Practice) what Power the Magiſtrate hath, or may have in ſome caſes to command Miniſters to exerciſe their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry in ſuch or ſuch particular Pariſhes; for
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:40126:86"/> that which they accepted and made uſe of, was the relaxation from the Civil reſtraint; and they were called by theſe Pariſhes to preach and do their parts of the Miniſtry there.</p>
               <p>What he ſaith pag 91. Sect. 3. concerning plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tranſplanting, and placing Miniſters in particular charges, is obviated already. If he would have diſputed fairly, he ſhould have kept the terms of the Councils Acts of appointing, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, permitting Miniſters to preach in ſuch and ſuch places, and not have thruſt in his own words of poteſtative miſſion, planting and tranſplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>We heard before what words are uſed in the firſt Book of Diſcipline, as nominating, compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, appointing, aſſigning. And in the ſecond Book of Diſcipline, placing Miniſters; and Mr. <hi>Welſh</hi> doth not find fault with King <hi>James</hi>'s uſing the word of planting every Pariſh within his Kingdom; but as was ſaid, the Indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters needs not have recourſe to theſe defences. Any who conſiders, that Presbyterial Government was overturned before theſe Acts of Indulgence, and Prelacy ſetled by Law, may think ſtrange, that he blames the Council for not conſulting Kirk-judicatories. There were no Presbyterial Church-judicatories to conſult, and the Prelates did not like the Indulgence; and the conſulting them in the matter, would have readily ſcared Presbyterians from making any uſe of the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
               <p>He ſaith in that ſame Section, <hi>That it was the Councils deed alone which did conſtitute all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40126:86"/> Miniſters in ſuch and ſuch places, and ſo made up that relation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this is falſe, and a begging of the queſtion; for they who returned to their own Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had a ſtanding relation to theſe Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and they who had not acceſs to their own, did not, till they had Invitation from the Pariſhes, to which they went, and the conſent of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Miniſters concerned, conceive themſelves obliged to exerciſe their Miniſtry among them; far leſs did they think, that the Councils deed did conſtitute them Miniſters of theſe Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and make up that relation; for if they had thought ſo, they would have thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to have gone to theſe Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the Councils deed. Concerning the overſight that they have of theſe Congregations, we ſpoke before, and muſt not continually weary the Reader with Repetitions.</p>
               <p>He frequently carps at their getting the ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend; I know not whom he would have to get theſe ſtipends, ſeeing he is againſt the Indulged Miniſters getting of them: as for the Councils deſign of fixing them in other charges than their own, the Indulged Miniſters are not Maſters of the deſigns of any perſons, but their own; but the deſign of theſe Miniſters was to return to their own Congregations aſſoon as they had peaceable acceſs. Nor could the Indulged Miniſters hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Council to have regard to the conſent of the Patrons, but they had no regard to it. He refers us to his ſecond remark on the Kings Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I find no new thing in it; he taxes the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:40126:87"/> Miniſters ſilence, and alledges that by their ſilence they interpretatively aſſented to the uſurpation; but they were not ſilent, as we heard before. But I would enquire as to the point now in hand, to wit, the Council appointing Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to preach in ſuch and ſuch places, What he would have had theſe Miniſters to ſay? Would he have had theſe who were appointed to return to thoſe Pariſhes where they were ordained Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, to have told the Council they would not go to theſe Pariſhes, becauſe they had appointed them to go? Or would he have had theſe who were appointed to go to other Pariſhes than their own, to have refuſed abſolutely to go, becauſe they appointed them to go? They did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe them to go to preach in thoſe Pariſhes; but it had been raſhneſs and unreaſonable raſhneſs to have abſolutely refuſed to go, and to go upon that account; and therefore as they acknowledged not any relation betwixt them and theſe Pariſhes upon the Councils Act, and did not oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before the Council to go to theſe Pariſhes; ſo they did not go until they were invited by theſe Congregations. To have abſolutely refuſed to preach in theſe Congregations, before they had heard what was the reſolution of theſe Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations who were concerned as well as they in that matter, had been a prepoſterous haſte; and they could not have given any rational account to the Council of ſuch a refuſal or proteſtation: for if the Council had inquired, Why will ye not go to preach there? if they had anſwered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Authors mind, they behoved to have
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:40126:87"/> ſaid, Becauſe your <hi>L. L.</hi> appoints me to go there and preach, and I can preach no where where ye command me to preach; for I muſt preach contrary to your command; for ſo he ſtates the matter pag. 129. had not this been humour and no reaſon? if the Magiſtrate had been diſpoſed to make themſelves ſport, they might have ſaid, Then we diſcharge you to preach in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation which we appointed you to preach in before, and we appoint you to preach any where elſe; if the Miniſter concerned would have been ruled by this Authors reaſon, or humour rather, he would have anſwered, Then I will preach in that Congregation where ye firſt appointed me to preach in, and no other place; this had been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ridiculous!</p>
               <p>The Magiſtrate needs not keep ſoldiers under pay to hinder any of this humour from preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any place; for they need do no more, but appoint them to preach in any place, and they may be ſure they will not preach there; or if they would have them to preach in any place, they may forbid them to preach there, and they may be ſure they will do it; for this croſs humour will act contrary to what is commanded.</p>
               <p>Pag. 91. Sect. 4. Relates to the Canons; of theſe we have ſpoken before. The Indulged Miniſters accepting of the relaxation of the rigour of Civil Edicts, hath no neceſſary connexion with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of the Magiſtrates power to make Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiatical Canons. The Author hath ſaid, <hi>That it hath ſuch a connexion,</hi> but he hath never ſhown what he ſaid; but he ſays <hi>this will abundantly evince it,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:40126:88"/> that if they had received the ſame or like Indulgence at the hands of the Prelates, clogged with the ſame or like injunctions, this would have been a granting to the Prelate that power to make ſuch injunctions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> He knows that in the Judgment of the Presbyterians, the power that Magiſtrates hath from God, and the exerciſe of that Power, is Gods Ordinance; and the taking off the reſtraint ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſpoken of, was the exerciſe of the Magiſtrates lawful Authority. But Presbyterians do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Prelacy, nor the exerciſe of it to be the Ordinance of God. And therefore there is a great difference betwixt the uſe-making of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence from the Magiſtrate, and from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. But if that were granted, that a Prelate had the ſame power from God, that the Magiſtrate hath, to do what the Magiſtrate did in taking off the reſtraint; and then ſuppoſe the Miniſters to have declared themſelves in reference to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, as they did before the Council, they could not have been at all charged with granting any ſuch power of making inſtructions to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late; but this Scarcrow is good enough to beguile ſimple people.</p>
               <p>I have often obſerved, that the apparent ſtrength of all that is ſaid againſt the Indulged Miniſters pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, lies in a confuſed miſtaking of the queſtion, and in falſe alledgances, and halting ſimilitudes and parables.</p>
               <p>To what he ſaith pag. 92. Sect. 5. It's anſwered, That it is not in the Acts of Indulgence ſo eaſie to prove, as to ſay, That the Magiſtrate hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the power of exerciſing real Church-Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:40126:88"/> but ſuppoſe that could be proven, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove that the Indulged Miniſters are any ways acceſſary to their aſſuming any ſuch power.</p>
               <p>Pag. 92. he ſaith, <hi>Our third head of Arguments againſt this Indulgence, is taken from its relation to, affinity with, dependence upon, and Confirmation by that woful Act of Supremacy made by our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> 1669.</p>
               <p>He grants ſeveral times in that Book, that the Indulged Miniſters did not formally and expreſly own, acknowledg, acquieſce in, or approve of the Eccleſiaſtick ſupremacy, in and by their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of the Indulgence; and that he is far from thinking that they had any intention to make way for, approve of, or confirm the ſaid Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, pag. 33. and elſe-where; but he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges they are interpretatively guilty. But this is but a mean alledgance; for as the Magiſtrates Acts of permitting or appointing Miniſters to preach, are not Acts flowing from any ſinful Supremacy, as hath been cleared from the Books of Diſcipline; and theſe were the Acts which were properly the Acts of Indulgence; So much leſs can the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates Act of relaxing of the reſtraint, be called an Act of ſinful Supremacy; it was a part of right which they were obliged unto, and it was only this relaxation which the Indulged Miniſters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and made uſe of, as is clear from Mr. <hi>Hutcheſons</hi> Speech; and if he would have ſaid any thing to the purpoſe, he ſhould have proven that this was an homologating of an <hi>Eraſtian,</hi> or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Supremacy in the Magiſtrate. But he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attempts this, and he did beſt never to eſſay
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:40126:89"/> to do that which he knew he could not do: but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his confuſed way, he takes the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence for all the Acts of the Magiſtrate, relating to the Indulgence, and ſhews what affinity ſome of theſe have with the Supremacy; and this he labours in from pag. 25. till pag. 33. but what will he infer from that? ſhall the Indulged Miniſters be guilty of homologating the Supremacy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Magiſtrates Acts have affinity one with another, and relate one to another? How knows he that we would never have ſeen the Act of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, if the Indulgence had been utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed? this is but his own conjecture, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures made upon mens deſigns; and Statemens deſigns are very uncertain.</p>
               <p>I was ſurprized pag. 93. Sect. 2. When I found him abuſing the Indulgence, as an illigitimate brood, becauſe it was directly againſt law; he means the Laws made in favour of the Prelates; for I thought he would have liked it the better, becauſe it was contrary to Law, and ſuch Laws, If he could have ſaid, that the taking the reſtraint off theſe Miniſters, had been contrary to the Law of God, it would have been more to his purpoſe; but that he could not ſay. In his Sect. 3. he ſpeaks as if he minded to perſwade the Indulged Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to take ſhelter under the wings of the Act of Supremacy, againſt the charge of Sedition; but I do not think that ever any Indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter thought of this for a refuge.</p>
               <p>His Sect. 4. refers to the two foregoing heads of which we have ſpoken. His 5th. Sect. contains Mr. <hi>Burnets</hi> Argument, which ſhews a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:40126:89"/> betwixt the Act of Supremacy and the complex Acts of Indulgence, but it concludes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt the practice of the Indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, or what they did upon or after the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. As for his 6th Sect. it's more likely that that Act was made to ſalve theſe he ſpeaks of in his Sect. 1. than to ſupport the Indulgence; but theſe things are little or nothing to the purpoſe. To his Sect. 7. That the taking off the reſtraint, or the giving relaxation from the reſtraint, did flow from no uſurped power in the King and Council; it was the product of that power which every Magiſtrate hath from God, pag. 94. To his 8th. where he again brings in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates Indulgence, we ſpoke before. His 9th. about the Prelates Collation, is to the ſame purpoſe; he ſtill begs the queſtion when he ſuppoſes, that what the Indulged Miniſters made uſe of, flowed from an unlawful power. In his Sect. 10. he hath the faſhion of an Argument, but he begs the queſtion; for he takes for granted, what he ſhould have proven. The Indulged Miniſters did no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:40126:90"/> That the Magriſtrate may in ſome caſes appoint and compel Miniſters to preach where there is need. He knows alſo that the Indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters who were appointed to go to other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations than their own, did not upon the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates appointment go, till they were invited by the people; and would not have gone, if they had not been invited; and his alledgance that that they accepted Inſtructions, Orders, Acts and Conſtitutions, to regulate them in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their Miniſtry, is a falſe alledgance. He ſays he hath cleared it above; but he hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cleared it above or under.</p>
               <p>I cleared from his own Confeſſion, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Miniſters gave an honeſt Teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe Inſtructions.

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:40126:90" rendition="simple:additions"/> virtually, implicitely, materially, interpretatively guilty of it; that's to ſay, they are guilty of it, but they cannot tell how: and yet upon this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretative Homologation which they cannot interpret nor underſtand, they are adviſed to withdraw from hearing the Indulged Miniſters. The caſe of the poor people is much to be pitied, who are thus made to ſtumble at they know not what, and made to believe that the Indulged Miniſters homologate a ſinful Supremacy in the Magiſtrate; and that they in hearing the Indulged Miniſters, homologate the Supremacy; and ſome have gone that length, that the Miniſters who preach not againſt hearing of the Indulged Miniſters, are not to be heard; and upon the ſame groundleſs grounds they may give up private Chriſtian fellowſhip with thoſe who are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt hearing the Indulged Miniſters.</p>
               <p>I remember a Hiſtory which I read of one <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Liege,</hi> who upon the approach of ſome enemies againſt that Town, took ſuch a pannick fear, that he fled into the deſert of <hi>Ardenna,</hi> and durſt not adventure to come out; for he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended that all men that he heard or ſaw, were thoſe enemies which firſt frighted him. It hath befallen this Author, and the Author of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, as it did to him; they have taken ſuch a fright at the Supremacy, that they apprehend many Acts to be Acts of Supremacy, which others, who are as oppoſite to Eraſtianiſm, and an arbitrary Supremacy as they, know to be Acts of that Authority which the Magiſtrate hath from God; and they apprehend many things to have
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:40126:91"/> affinity with the Supremacy, which have none at all; but this way of theirs is ſo far from being the right way to diſcern the ill which is in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, that upon the contrary, it's the way to commend it, when theſe Acts which Orthodox and Anti-Eraſtian Divines grant to be Acts of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority, are alledged to be the Acts of a ſinful Supremacy.</p>
               <p>Pag. 95. We have his fourth ground. I need not repeat the true ſtate of the queſtion; he ſhould have proven, if he would have proven any thing againſt the Indulged Miniſters, that their practice was injurious to the people. I know no injury they have done to the people, except that be an injury, that upon their Invitation they came and preached the truth to them. I think they may be forgiven this wrong.</p>
               <p>He ſays, <hi>The meer appointment of the civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, was all the ground of their relation, and the only thing that made them Paſtors to ſuch a people.</hi> This is falſe, and will never be proven.</p>
               <p>I told him, the Indulged Miniſters had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Patron. He objects, that it will be ſaid they obtained the full and unanimous conſent of the people. And he anſwers 1. <hi>I doubt if this was either univerſally ſought or obtained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Seeing he charges the indulged Miniſters as injurious to the people, he ſhould have been clear, that they obtruded themſelves upon the people; and that the people did not conſent to their coming. It ſeems he makes his doubts to be evidences to prove his Brethren guilty of injurious dealing. But he might have known, that no man
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:40126:91"/> who hath any common ſenſe, will take the moſt confident aſſertions of an accuſer, and much leſs his doubts, for proofs and evidences againſt the party whom he charges with a fault.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for thoſe who returned to their own Congregations, they had a ſtanding relation foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the election of the people, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Presbytery; and none can ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally imagine, that their own Congregations did not deſire the return of their own Paſtors. As for thoſe who went to other Congregations, not having acceſs to their own; I ſuppoſe he would not have thought it ſutable for them to have ſought Invitations to theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes. It was not the Cuſtom, nor had it been decent, but very unſutable and liable to Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to have ſought Invitations; it was all that could be rationally expected from them, to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to the people concerned, that they could not come to exerciſe their Miniſtry among them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they did conſent. Neither had it been fit for the people to have made a formal election of them, ſeeing they had never heard, nor ſeen ſome of them; and ſeeing theſe Miniſters were not out of hope of obtaining regreſs to their own Pariſhes; but all that was neceſſary, as the caſe ſtood, was the peoples conſent to their coming and preaching among them; and when they had heard them, both the Miniſters and they might conſider what was fit for them to do. I ſhall ſet down a true Copy of one of theſe Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:40126:92"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>We under Subſcribers in the Pariſh of—being informed by very many Teſtimonies, to which we owe credit, That it hath pleaſed the Lord to endue you with great Abilities for preaching the Goſpel, and that upon our call you have free acceſs to come and exerciſe the Miniſterial Function among us; have thought it our Duty to give you a very cordial Invitation to come and preach, which we expect may be upon Sunday, the fifteenth of this inſtant; after which we are not doubtful, but both you and we ſhall have ſuch mutual ſatisfaction, that we ſhall have the Comfort of your Miniſtry, and you the opportunity of doing ſervice to your Lord and Maſter, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of the Commiſſion you have from him, in whom we remain and ſubſcribe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>By this it appears, 1. That the people were informed, that the Miniſter had ſignified, That an Invitation from the Pariſh was neceſſary for his acceſs to preach to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though they expreſs their hopes, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his preaching among them, both they and he ſhould have mutual ſatisfaction; yet they do not determine themſelves, nor pretend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Miniſter; ſo that both they and he were at liberty, as to a mutual ſetling.</p>
               <p>Now when ſuch an Invitation was given by perſons having ſpecial intereſt, and not without the knowledge of the people who had place, to have objected if they had any thing to ſay; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people upon the Miniſters coming to preach, did willingly come and hear, and continued to do ſo, and to frequent Diets of Catechiſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:40126:92" rendition="simple:additions"/> What further could be deſired, as matters then ſtood? the people were willing that theſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters come to preach; and when they had heard them, they willingly attended upon their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; and that very unanimouſly, until about the time of the ſecond Indulgence, ſome made it their work firſt in private, and then more publickly, to perplex the poor people with ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. I ſay, what further could be deſired? and as the matter was circumſtantiate, it had been unfit to have uſed any more formalities in the matter, ſeeing there was a real willingneſs in the people to attend upon the Ordinances diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed by theſe Miniſters.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſays, <hi>Where this conſent was had, it was but a meer blind, and to me a meer proſtituting of that Appointment and Order of Chriſt, rather than any conſcientious obſervation thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is a very high charge againſt theſe deſtitute Congregations; and I doubt not to ſay, it is a blind accuſation to charge a deſtitute Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, becauſe they deſired a Miniſter of the Goſpel to preach the Goſpel to them, with ſuch an odious crime as the proſtituting of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and order of Chriſt. When he was charging others as injurious to the people, he ſhould not have wronged them himſelf, as if they minded to deceive themſelves or others, to put out their own eyes, or the eyes of others, by a blind, and as if they made not Conſcience of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Chriſts Order, but had proſtituted it. But let us hear his Reaſon.</p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:40126:93"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>For</hi> 3. (ſaith he) <hi>this call of the people ought to be a free Election and Choice; but there was no free Election left unto them; but whether they did conſent or not, the perſon deſigned by the Council, was to be ſet over them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I ſhewed before, That the peoples Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was free, and Mr. <hi>Thomas Wylie</hi> in his paper hath made it very evident there was no force upon the people; they might have invited or not, as they thought fit. There have been many free Invitations, where there hath not been a comparative preferring of one to others; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral people have never had thoughts of any but of one to be their Miniſter; there may be the greateſt freedom without a formal choice of one out of many, upon comparing them one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
               <p>I wonder how he could ſay, <hi>That whether the people had conſented or not, the perſon deſigned by the Council was to be ſet over them.</hi> How knew he that? did he know the ſecret purpoſes of thoſe Miniſters, that they would obtrude themſelves upon the people againſt their will? or that the Council would make theſe Miniſters preach, and the people hear againſt their wills? Both the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters knew that they would not preach to theſe people without their conſent; and the people knew that theſe Miniſters would not preach to them except they conſented; but this Author knew, it ſeems, more than they all. He had it ſeems a <hi>ſcientia media</hi> of his own, by which he knew what the Indulged Miniſters would do, upon ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that the people did not conſent. He is a
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:40126:93" rendition="simple:additions"/> little too homely with the Indulged Miniſters; for he not only impoſes harangues upon them, of his own making, and makes them ſpeak contrary to their own mind; and impoſes Creeds upon them of his own making, and makes them to believe what they never thought; but alſo he takes on him to tell, that they would have done that which they reſolved not to have done. This is very ſtrange, that he ſhould make himſelf not only Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of their mouths, and of their faith, but alſo of their wills and future actions! But ſuppoſe that event which he not only without, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to reaſon, takes upon him, as if he had been a Prophet to foretel, had fallen, or would have fallen out; yet this could not make the peoples Invitation unlawful, becauſe the lawfulneſs or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs of actions is to be meaſured by their conformity or diſconformity to the rule by their conſtituent cauſes, and concomitant circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are in being when the action is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and not from future events.</p>
               <p n="4">4. (Saith he) <hi>The free election of the people ſhould go before the perſons deſignation to that charge, and become the foundation of his relation to that flock; but here it was poſterior to the Councils deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and was a meer precarious thing, coming</hi> ex poſt facto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Indulged Miniſters had not the diſpoſal of the time of the Councils actings, as was ſaid before; but the peoples Invitation was before theſe Miniſters preaching to theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes.</p>

But any may ſee that the Magiſtrates not mentioning of the peoples Invitation, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not vitiate the peoples Invitation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. He addeth, <hi>Nor did they make any mention hereof, when hefore the Council, nor make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt the Councils order or collation, until this was had.</hi>

               <p>If they had mentioned the peoples Call be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Council, it might have been he would have alledged, That this was a bringing of the peoples Call under the Cognizance of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; and it might have occaſioned the Council to enquire after the peoples calls, and to have urged people contrary to their Inclinations, to have given calls; yea, the Councils requiring them to give calls, would have occaſioned ſcruples to ſome people, and this might have expoſed them to ſuffering; or if they had upon the Magiſtrates interpoſing, given Invitations, it might have been
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40126:94"/> alledged, That they were conſtrained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. If the Miniſters had rejected the Councils Act, till once they had the peoples Call, then this would have either provoked the Magiſtrate to retract their Act, and give no Indulgence; which is the thing that this Author would have been at; for, if he thinks it a diſparagement to the Pariſhes, that their Act is poſterior to the Councils, he was or might be ſure the Council would think it a diſparagement to have their Act not only poſterior to the Pariſh Act, but alſo except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt and caſten, till the Pariſh Act went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for the Council would have thought it as great a diſparagement to their Act to be trailed at the heels of the peoples Act, as he thinks it for the peoples Act to be trailed at the heels of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils Acts. This would have brought in a very odious queſtion about precedency betwixt the Council and the Pariſh. Or if the Council had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſettle ſuch a Miniſter in ſuch a Pariſh, and ſaw that he would not go without the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people; this would have put them to urge the Pariſh, as thinking it a diſparagement to have their Act made void by the Pariſh-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal. If the Pariſh had refuſed to give a reaſon of their refuſal, they would have uſed them the more hardly. If they had excepted againſt the Miniſters Qualifications, Doctrine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this would have entangled the people to have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued theſe matters before the Magiſtrate as the Judge competent.</p>
               <p>Theſe Miniſters intending to make uſe of the Councils Act, in ſo far as it was ſome relaxation
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:40126:95"/> of the reſtraint formerly laid on, and as it did make way for the peaceable exerciſe of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry in ſome Pariſhes, and minding to have it free to thoſe Pariſhes to invite and not to invite them, as they ſaw fit, and to themſelves to go or not to go, as they found it fit; it was very convenient that they ſhould not make mention of the Pariſhes or their Invitations; for this might have either needleſly irritated the Council, and provoked them to undo what they had done, or elſe have entangled themſelves and the Pariſhes. They declared before the Council, that they had full preſcriptions from Chriſt to regulate them in their Miniſtry; and a violent obtruding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon a people without their conſent, had been contrary to theſe Preſcriptions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the known Judgment of Presbyterians.</p>

The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſeaſon of proteſting againſt Patronages, had been when they were to eſtabliſh them by Law; and it concerned all the Miniſters as well as theſe Ten who were firſt indulged, and it would have ſeemed impertinent enough for them to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted againſt the Patrons for conſenting to their coming to ſuch Pariſhes; if a Patron had been holding them out of a Pariſh they had right to be
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40126:95"/> in, it had been more pertinent in that caſe to have proteſted, than in this. When a Patron had given his conſent without the Miniſters know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, could theſe Miniſters hinder the Patron to conſent? or the Council to have regard to his conſent? but they declared their adherence to their known Judgments, and conſequently that they were not for Patronages.</p>

               <p>As for his <hi>Dilemma</hi> pag. 96. Sect. 2. It's eaſily anſwered, they look on themſelves as having a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to their former charges, and would return if they could have a peaceable acceſs to their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry there. Until that be obtained, the exerciſe of the Miniſtry is not the worſe that it is fixed; for as was ſaid, the fixed exerciſe of the Miniſtry hath many advantages, which an unfixed exerciſe of the Miniſtry wants. He ſeems to make un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed Miniſters to be Curates; <hi>for,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if they look not on themſelves as fixed Paſtors, then are they Curates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is an injurious Inference to the Miniſters who have not the fixed exerciſe of their Miniſtry. But it may poſſibly be ſaid, that he calls them
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:40126:96"/> Curates, becauſe of the Councils Order, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Council can turn them out when they pleaſe; but I do not ſee how that makes them Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates more than it did under the former ſuppoſition of their owning themſelves as fixed Miniſters; for whether they look on themſelves as fixed or unfixed, the Councils Act is the ſame, and the Council can as eaſily turn them out, though they ſuppoſe themſelves fixed, as they can when they ſuppoſe themſelves unfixed; ſo that this horn of his <hi>Dilemma</hi> hath no force, except it be in that, That unfixed Miniſters are Curates, which is a falſe and injurious aſſertion.</p>
               <p>I ſee no neceſſary Connexion betwixt Curates and unfixedneſs; for the name of Curate ſeems to import that they are fixed to a Cure. And I do not remember that ever I heard unfixed Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters deſigned Curates; he might have bethought himſelf, that ſome Miniſters who went to <hi>Holland,</hi> might be toſſed betwixt the Horns of this horned Argument; and if it have any force, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not decline the force thereof. For, if they were fixed Paſtors of that Congregation in <hi>Holland,</hi> where they ordinarily preached, what becomes of their relation to their former charges? if they were not fixed, then were they Curates; the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates in <hi>Holland</hi> could turn them out when they pleaſed, as well as the Magiſtrates in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> They continued only during the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates pleaſure; and when the Magiſtrate thought fit to turn them out of that place where they had the publick exerciſe of their Miniſtry, they could not ſtay whether the Magiſtrate would or
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:40126:96"/> not. The Indulged Miniſters have often declared their relation to their former charges, and their deſire to return to them, if they could have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; and when they began to preach to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, among whom they labour for the preſent, they declared they were ordained Miniſters of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Congregations: And neither by word nor writ did they engage themſelves not to return to their former charges, as they ſay this Author did; and they did nothing which might obſtruct their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to theſe charges; their fixed preaching in one Congregation, ſo long as they have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, is no more obſtructive to their return, than the preaching of other outed Miniſters in many places, is obſtructive to their returning to their former charges.</p>
               <p>And if the Author had conſidered what he himſelf writes afterward, pag. 103. Sect. 8. he would have ſeen how unequally he deals with the Indulged Miniſters.</p>
               <p>He ſays, <hi>In King</hi> James's <hi>days, ſeveral faithful and honeſt Miniſters were baniſhed from their own Churches, and confined in other places of the Land; and ſeeing no hope of getting the Civil Sentence taken off, were neceſſitated to accept of a call to ſerve the Lord in the places where they were confined.</hi> Now he might have ſeen that this was much more than the Indulged Miniſters did. He adds in that ſame place, <hi>But we never find that they took the charge of ſuch or ſuch a flock, upon the Edict or Act of the Council enjoyning them thereto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we ſee that the Miniſters not only took the charge of other Congregations, but quit
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:40126:97"/> hopes of returning to their former charges; and yet he acknowledges them faithful and honeſt Miniſters: but if the Indulged Miniſters had thus abſolutely ſetled in other Congregations than their own, it would have been judged by this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, unfaithfulneſs and diſhoneſty. What? is it diſhoneſty in theſe Miniſters, that they have not quit all hope of returning to their former char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges? For I ſee no difference betwixt them and theſe honeſt Miniſters, but in this, that they hold out longer in hoping a return, than they did. As for what he ſays in the end of that Section, That theſe honeſt Miniſters took not the charge of theſe flocks where they were confined, upon the Edict of the Council enjoyning them thereto; it makes no difference: for the Indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters did not take the charge of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons where they preach, upon the Act of the Council, as is well known to all who will not ſhut their eyes, and are not blinded with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</p>
               <p>What the Author hath ſaid in theſe few lines, pag. 103. Sect. 8. overturns a great part of his Book. The Author hath uſed divers weights, and deals not equally with the Indulged Miniſters. If they had lived in King <hi>James</hi>'s time, though they had done more than they have done, they might have been honeſt and faithful men, though they had abſolutely taken the charge of other Congregations than thoſe in which, they were ordained Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Pag. 96. We have his fifth ground of diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction with the Indulgence, and with the accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof. He ſtill miſtakes the queſtion. If he
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:40126:97"/> would have ſaid any thing againſt the Indulged Miniſters, he ſhould have proven that their Practice had eſtabliſhed Eraſtianiſm; but that had been too hard a Task for him, and therefore he did wiſely not to undertake it. It cannot be proven that the Magiſtrate practiſed Eraſtianiſm in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing the Civil reſtraint which hindred the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able exerciſe of their Miniſtry; or that they eſtabliſhed Eraſtianiſm in making uſe of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation.</p>
               <p>In his Sect. 1. he refers the Reader to what he hath ſaid under the firſt, ſecond and third heads; and I need not repeat what hath been anſwered to theſe heads.</p>
               <p>In his 2d. he ſays, <hi>That hereby the Magiſtrate is confirmed in that uſurpation of being proper judges of Miniſters Doctrine, even in the firſt inſtance, that is, before any Church Judicatory take cognition thereof, and paſs a Judgment thereupon.</hi> And he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers us to his 8th. remark upon the Kings Letter; the words of the Kings Letter, as he hath related them, are pag. 4. <hi>And upon complaint made and verified of any ſeditious diſcourſe or expreſſions in the Pulpit, or elſewhere uttered by any of thoſe Miniſters, you are immediately to turn them out, and further puniſh them according to Law, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the offence.</hi> His remark is pag. 14. he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, <hi>That the Council is to take notice of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Miniſters ſpeeches in the Pulpit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It ſeems he is not againſt the Councils taking notice of their ſeditious ſpeeches elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; for he paſſes that which the Council is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to take notice of; but if there be no fault in
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:40126:98"/> the Councils taking notice of ſeditious diſcourſes elſewhere, it will be unreaſonable to hinder them from taking notice of ſeditious ſpeeches uttered in the Pulpit; for ſeditious diſcourſes in the Pulpit, are not the better, but the worſe, that they are ſpoken in the Pulpit; and they are the more dangerous, and may readily be the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious, that they are ſpoken, as if they were the word of God; and ſo may readily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the hearers, who cannot diſcern the word of God; and there is no ſedition more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, than that which pretends to be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the word of God. No ſober perſon will ſay, That the Pulpit priviledges a Miniſter to ſpeak ſedition; and that the Magiſtrate may not take notice of ſeditious diſcourſes, if they be uttered in the Pulpit.</p>
               <p>He adds, <hi>By which we ſee the Council is made the immediate formal Judge of Miniſters Doctrine; for under the pretext of ſeditious Doctrine, they may condemn the moſt Innocent and Orthodox Truths. No Anti-Eraſtian Divine will grant this unto the Civil Magiſtrate; and though it be true, that the Civil Magiſtrate can only and properly judge of what is truly ſeditious, and can only civilly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh for ſuch crimes; yet our Divines never granted that the Magiſtrates might</hi> in prima inſtantia <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and judge of Miniſters Doctrine when al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be ſeditious and treaſonable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> His firſt inference, that the Council is made the immediate formal Judge of Miniſters Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, will be denyed till it be better proven than the Author hath proven it; for it only fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:40126:98"/> that the Magiſtrate is the Judge of ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſpeeches and diſcourſes; and this is no abſurdity, even in this Authors opinion; for he grants that the Civil Magiſtrate can only and properly judge of what is truly ſeditious. <hi>But,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>under the pretext of ſeditious Doctrine, they may judge and condemn the moſt Innocent and Orthodox truths.</hi> I reply, ſo Church-judicatory under the pretext of error or ſcandal, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn Orthodox truths, and innocent Practiſes. But I hope he will not deny, that becauſe a Kirk-judicatory, corrupt in all its members, or in the major part of its members, may condemn Orthodox Truths, that therefore Church-judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories are not the competent Judges of Truth and Error; or of what is ſcandalous, and what not; and if the Errors of Kirk-men does not deſtroy the Power and Authority which Chriſt hath given to Eccleſiaſtical Courts to judge of Doctrine, and to cenſure Hereſie and Scandals; ſo the Errors of Magiſtrates, who take innocent Truths for ſeditious Errors, does not deſtroy and make void that Authority which God hath given to Magiſtrates to judge and puniſh ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Diſcourſes.</p>
               <p>I cannot well ſee how, according to this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors opinion, the Magiſtrate can have acceſs to judge of Sedition, if it be vented in the Pulpit; <hi>For he cannot judge it,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in prima inſtantia.</hi> He will have the Kirk-judicatories Judgment to precede; but again he binds the Kirk-judicatory up, that it cannot judge what is ſeditious; <hi>For,</hi> ſaith this Author, <hi>the Civil Magiſtrate can only
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:40126:99"/> and properly judge what is truly ſeditious;</hi> and therefore if the Civil Magiſtrate may not judge of Sedition till the Church hath judged it <hi>in prima inſtantia,</hi> I ſee not how they can judge it at all; for if they whom he will have to judge <hi>in prima inſtantia,</hi> cannot judge of Sedition at all, their <hi>prima inſtantia</hi> will never be, and the Magiſtrates <hi>ſecunda inſtantia</hi> will never come; for the firſt inſtance muſt be before the ſecond. If the Kirk-judicatory may not judge what is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious, as he granteth, then it would ſeem that the Magiſtrate muſt judge what is ſeditious <hi>in prima inſtantia,</hi> if he judge at all in that matter. And it ſeems very hard to bind up the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that he may not judge of ſeditious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or whether Doctrine was ſeditious or not, till there be a precedent Judgment of the Church; for what if there be no Church-Courts, or none to which the Miniſter who is accuſed of ſeditious ſpeeches, hath clearneſs to anſwer? what if the Magiſtrate think, and, it may be, have reaſon to think, that the Church-Court is diſaffected to the Magiſtrate, and favours ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious diſcourſes? Suppoſe the Court be incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and not ſuſpected to the Magiſtrate; what if the Magiſtrate think it dangerous to ſuffer the Miniſter who preaches ſeditiouſly, to preach on till the Eccleſiaſtick proceſs againſt him be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſeeing ſuch proceſſes uſe to be long, and they be apprehenſive, that his ſeditious Diſcourſes may bring forth very dangerous effects, before the Eccleſiaſtick Court can (obſerving their Order and way of proceeding) inflict any Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:40126:99"/> cenſure upon him; and they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that the fire of ſedition muſt be quickly ſuppreſſed that it do not ſpread?</p>
               <p>I would gladly know what the Author would have a Miniſter do, when he is cited to appear before the Magiſtrate for ſpeaking ſeditious ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches? would he have him refuſe to come till the Kirk-judicatories ended their proceſs? But what if the Magiſtrate will not wait ſo long? then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Miniſter hath uttered ſpeeches really ſeditious; and in that caſe the Author grants, That the Magiſtrate is the only Judge of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If his ſpeeches have not been ſeditious, but the words of Truth, then he hath an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity not only of vindicating himſelf of the crime of Sedition, but alſo of vindicating the truth, and of inſtructing and edifying the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate; and who knows, but a plain, ſober, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Vindication of the truth, may be bleſſed of God to diſcover to the Magiſtrate his Error, and the Innocency of the Miniſter accuſed; and that any injury done to the Miniſter for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of God, would be a fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the God of truth. Every Chriſtian ſhould be ready always to give an anſwer to every man that asketh them a reaſon of the hope that is in them,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24, 25, 26.</note> with meekneſs and fear. And eſpecially <hi>the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, in meekneſs inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves; if God paradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:40126:100"/> and that they may recover themſelves out of the ſnare of the Devil, who are taken Captives by him at his will.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Jeremiah</hi> is brought before the Princes, and accuſed for the Doctrine he had taught; he does not refuſe to anſwer to the Accuſation, but ſhews, That his Doctrine was of God; and takes that occaſion to exhort all that were hearing him, to amend their doings; and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures them, that if they put him to death, they would bring innocent blood upon themſelves; and this Doctrine hath a good effect upon the Princes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 26.10. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> refuſes not to declare what he had taught to the <hi>Roman</hi> Judges; he ſought and took all opportunities of preaching the Goſpel; he did not ſubmit his Doctrine to their deciſive Judgment; for though they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the Truth, he would have ſtill juſtified it, and would have pitied them as blind; but he was always before all perſons ready to preach the Goſpel, of which he was not aſhamed.</p>
               <p>The true ſtrength of the cauſe of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt when they are brought before Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers for preaching of the Truth, doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in ſome formalities which men uſe in litigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pleas, but in the plain declaring of the Truth of God, which is mighty through God, to the pulling down of ſtrong holds, caſting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:40126:100"/>
               <p>If the Magiſtrate take upon him to judge of Cauſes that are meerly Eccleſiaſtical, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt do their duty, when they tell the Magiſtrate, That ſuch cauſes are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the Church-Courts, and not by the Magiſtrate; but Sedition, by the Confeſſion of this Author, is none of theſe Cauſes which are meerly Eccleſiaſtical; for he grants that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate can only properly judge of what is truly ſeditious.</p>
               <p>The Hiſtorian doth not faithfully relate the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvine;</hi> for in <hi>Calder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods</hi> Hiſtory, pag. 144. we find that Mr. <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> at his firſt compearance before the King and Council, declared what he ſaid in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, without any Proteſtation. At his ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance he proteſts that he ſpoke nothing in that Sermon tending to the ſlander or diſhonour of the Kings Majeſty his Sovereign, any ways; on the contrary he exhorted always all his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs's Subjects to obedience and reverence of his Majeſty; and moſt earneſtly prayed for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and proſperous eſtate of his Majeſty. And after this he humbly proteſts, that in reſpect of Gods ordinance; Acts of Parliament and a late Conference betwixt ſome Lords and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters deputed by the King and Kirk, That the Trial might be remitted to the Judge Ordinary, which was the Aſſembly of the Kirk; then he pleads the priviledge of the Univerſity of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> the Members whereof were to be judged <hi>in prima inſtantia</hi> by the Rector and his Aſſeſſors. And then again he declares what he
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:40126:101"/> had ſpoken in that Sermon, that he might clear his Innocency, and remove all ſiniſtrous ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Thus it appears that Mr. <hi>Melvine</hi> anſwered concerning his Sermon, before he gave in that Proteſtation. And as to Mr. <hi>David Blakes</hi> decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature, we ſee pag. 340. of <hi>Calderwoods</hi> Story, That the Commiſſioners of the General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, declare that their intention in the Declinature, was no ways to diminiſh, hurt, or prejudice his Majeſties Authority by exeeming from the ſame Judicatory, any matter or cauſe civil or crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, committed by whatſoever perſons; and in this Mr. <hi>Guthrie</hi> agreed with them.</p>
               <p>In the cloſe of that 8. Section pag. 14. he blames the Indulged Miniſters for ſilence; and their ſilence, and not giving a Teſtimony, was, as he ſays, <hi>a Declaration that they were willing that all their Doctrine ſhould be immediately and</hi> in prima inſtantia <hi>judged and examined by the Council.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. As this part of the Kings Letter was not intimate to them; ſo though it had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, I do not ſee how they could in reaſon have proteſted againſt it; is there any Magiſtrate in the World, who will ſuffer Miniſters to preach ſeditious diſcourſes, if they can hinder them? and if for a reaſon of their Proteſtation they had ſaid, That by that means all their Doctrine would be brought under the Magiſtrates Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the Magiſtrate might have replyed, that by that reaſon they gave them to underſtand, that all their Doctrine would be ſeditious.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:40126:101"/>2. This Declaration is much like the Harangue and Creed which he impoſed upon the Indulged Miniſters in his firſt head of Arguments. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Miniſters cannot hinder men to make Creeds and Harangues, and Declarations, and then alledge that they are the Creeds and Declarations of the Indulged Miniſters. But it's ſad, that any man, and eſpecially a Miniſter, ſhould have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpent his time, to ſay no worſe, in making ſuch forgeries.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Indulged Miniſters declared, That they adhered to their known Judgment in Church-Affairs; now the known Judgment of Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians is oppoſite to this Declaration, which he falſly fathers upon the Indulged Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Pag. 96. 3. He ſaith, <hi>Hereby the Magiſtrate is confirmed in this uſurpation, that Miniſters may not preach in publick or in private, without Authoriy and Licenſe from the Civil Magiſtrate;</hi> and refers us to his 12th. Remark, which is pag. 16. what he ſays there, comes all to this; <hi>That the Magiſtrate looks upon them who preach without a borrowed Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the Magiſtrate, as ſeditious; and that this Indulgence in the ſenſe of the Court, was a clothing of the Indulged with Authority to preach; as if all they had from Chriſt had been null, and altogether inſignificant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I am wearied in repeating, that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting and uſe-making of the relaxation of the Civil reſtraint, did not confirm the Magiſtrate in any uſurpation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I do not think that the Magiſtrate ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that all the power theſe Miniſters had
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:40126:102"/> from Chriſt, was null, and inſignificant.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Suppoſe they had thought ſo, the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſters were ſo far from confirming them in that conceit, that they told them that they had received their Miniſtry from Jeſus Chriſt; but enough of this before.</p>
               <p>He adds Sect. 4. <hi>How this was confirmed and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to by the Indulged, we ſaw above in our Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Mr.</hi> H. <hi>Speech before the Council</hi> An 1669 <hi>and that Relation of the carriage and Speeches of thoſe who were before the Council</hi> Anno 1673.</p>

               <p>Now it cannot be denied, that the King by this Indulgence, did moderate the rigour of the penal Statutes. As for his 6. it's clear from Mr <hi>Hutcheſons</hi> Speech, That they did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cil; but what great matters he can make of that, I do not underſtand. For the Kings taking off that reſtraint, is no more an Act of any unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:40126:103"/> Supremacy, than the Councils taking it off. As for his Sect. 7. I have ſhewed at length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that it was the publick Exerciſe of their Miniſtry, freed of that long Civil reſtraint, for which Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon</hi> gives thanks, which is the ſame with the peaceable publick exerciſe of the Miniſtry; yea, in this ſame Section he juſtifies what Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon</hi> ſpoke, though he had not mentioned any reſtraint; for while he grants, that it is true, that Magiſtrates can hinder the peaceable publick exerciſe, or free publick exerciſe, he makes the peaceable publick exerciſe and the free publick exerciſe to be the ſame. The inferences that he would draw, <hi>viz.</hi> That theſe Miniſters did by this acknowledgment grant that there ought to be no publick exerciſe of the Miniſtry, without liberty granted from the Magiſtrate; and that they condemned Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miniſters who preached without that liberty granted by the Magiſtrate, are Inferences which are forged by the Authors phanſie, but do no way follow from Mr. <hi>Hutcheſons</hi> words. He that will conclude, that becauſe they thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that relaxation of the reſtraint which rendered their preaching hazardous, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none ought to preach except they were freed of ſuch Civil reſtraints, concludes without reaſon. Theſe Miniſters preached before the Indulgence, and would preach though the Indulgence were recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. The Inſtance of Mr. <hi>Bruce</hi>'s ſickneſs through terror of Conſcience for promiſing ſilence for ten days, would ſute better with thoſe who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed not to return to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and conſequently
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:40126:103"/> not to preach in it, than to the Indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters who never made ſuch Promiſe. His 8. Sect. is a foul miſrepreſentation of Mr. <hi>Hutcheſons</hi> words; <hi>for theſe Miniſters were not thankful for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking alone,</hi> as he ſays, <hi>but for partaking ſo early of that freedom from reſtraint and they deſire that others of their Brethren might ſhare with them in that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> I often wonder how his Conſcience could ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to write and print ſuch groſs and palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly falſe Reflexions upon his Brethren. He adds, <hi>That they ſuffered themſelves to be divided from their Brethren contrary to their ſworn Covenant.</hi> I anſwer, It ſeems he hath not minded this Reaſon when he took the opportunity of the peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry in <hi>Holland,</hi> when his Brethren in <hi>Scotland</hi> had it not.</p>
               <p>Such fooliſh Reaſonings are palpable wreſtings of the Covenant, and makes ſport to thoſe who are Adverſaries to it. Can any imagine, that the Covenant did oblige Miniſters not to preach in Kirks? except they preached all in Kirks? or if all were not ſuffered, then all ſhould quit their Kirks? this would condemn thoſe Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts who were ſuffered to continue in their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, when others were thruſt out: According to this conceit, if after the Act of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> which outed ſo many Miniſters; if the Council had made another Act, commanding them all to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their own charges, except one or two, they had been obliged not to return till thoſe two returned with them. By the ſame Reaſon, if a multitude of Covenanters were impriſoned, and they were all freed from Priſon except ſome few,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:40126:104"/> they might not come out of Priſon till they come out all together; or if ſome few were ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, they behoved to ſtay till all the reſt were ſet free. The Covenant obliged the Covenanters to united endeavours in their places and ſtations, to preſerve the good things, and oppoſe the evils mentioned in the Covenant; and it obliged them not to turn contrary to what they had ſworn, nor to turn indifferent and neutral; but it never obliged them to be always in the ſame Lot and Condition as to proſperity and adverſity; that if one were poor, impriſoned, baniſhed, put to death, all the reſt ſhould be ſo too; or that none ſhould take the benefit of deliverance from any diſtreſs, except all that were in diſtreſs were freed at the ſame time; this had been an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, unnatural, ſinful, and ridiculous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit! And yet I ſuppoſe the miſtake of ſome wel-meaning people in this point, hath tempted them to go out of the way that they ſhould have walked in, to ſeek ſufferings, becauſe they ſaw others were ſuffering. To his 9. concerning the leaving out of the word <hi>only,</hi> I have ſpoken at length before. His Sect. 10. pag. 25. concerning the Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, hath been alſo ſpoken to oftner than once. He alledgeth, <hi>they received other Preſcriptions from the Magiſtrate;</hi> this is falſe, as we have cleared at length before. And thus we ſee that his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of Mr. <hi>Hutcheſons</hi> Speech, doth not prove that the Indulged Miniſters confirmed the Magiſtrate in this uſurpation, that Miniſters may not preach in publick or private without Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Licenſe from the Civil Magiſtrate. And
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:40126:104"/> as for the Speeches of thoſe who appeared before the Council <hi>Anno</hi> 1673. we cleared from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors own words, That theſe Miniſters gave an honeſt Teſtimony againſt the Inſtructions.</p>
               <p>Pag. 96. Sect. 5. He charges all the Miniſters, and himſelf among the reſt, with a virtual cading and yielding to <hi>Eraſtian</hi> Invaſions and uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but he ſays, <hi>The Indulged Miniſters did wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſubmit to the Magiſtrates actual uſurpation of Church-power; and by accepting of the Indulgence, did put them in actual poſſeſſion of what was but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, and in the Theory arrogate formerly as to Nonconformiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Seeing he makes all the Miniſters guilty of a virtual cading to theſe Invaſions and uſurpations, if he deal with them as he doth with the Indulged Miniſters upon their virtual homologation of theſe uſurpations, he muſt juſtifie the people who withdraw from hearing of them; for as we heard before, he doth not charge the Indulged Miniſters with an explicite and formal homologating of theſe uſurpations, but only with a virtual homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logating of them. Now if all, even himſelf be guilty of this virtual yeilding, as he grants, I would enquire whom ſhall the people hear? Is not this the way to ſcare away the people from hearing all the Nonconformed Miniſters? But he will have the Indulged Miniſters more guilty; but he knows that <hi>magis &amp; minus non variant ſpeciem.</hi> His Reaſon is falſe; or the Indulged Miniſters did not ſubmit to any actual uſurpation; nor did they by any deed of theirs put the Magiſtrate in any
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:40126:105"/> actual poſſeſſion of ſuch an uſurpation. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts himſelf, when he ſaith, <hi>That theſe uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations were only in the Theory and notion, before the Indulgence;</hi> for the Magiſtrates altering of the Government of the Church, and ſetting up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of Church-government than was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and turning out of Miniſters, which this Author Interprets to be Depoſition; were not meer Speculations and Notions, but practiſes too too real and effectual.</p>
               <p>And in this ſame page he ſaith, <hi>This Eraſtianiſm and Supremacy hath acted and outed at it's pleaſure.</hi> They are very far out who think the outing of Miniſters to be nothing but Notions and The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory. His 6. is but a Repetition of what he ſaid before; for what the Indulged Miniſters did, was no virtual or real acknowledgment of Eraſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm.</p>
               <p>The Indulged Miniſters made uſe of what was good, and both in word and practice teſtified againſt what was evil in the complex Acts of Indulgence. He propoſes this exception, That the Indulged did only accept of a Licenſe, which when ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from its offenſive circumſtances, is a meer relaxation of the rigour of former Edicts. He anſwers 1. <hi>If this Indulgence did reſpect nothing but the perſons and eſtates of Miniſters, then it might be looked on as a meer relaxation of the rigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of former Edicts under which they groaned; but it's paſt all denyal, that this Indulgence relateth more, yea, and principally unto their Office and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and is deſigned, as is confeſſed, for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of an uſurped power over the Function of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:40126:105"/> the Miniſtry; yea, and includeth an acquieſcing and Submiſſion unto Acts made and propoſed by ſuch as confeſſedly act from a principle of uſurpation, and that for the better eſtabliſhment of the ſame, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of themſelves in the poſſeſſion thereof; and therefore the accepting of the Indulgence cannot but contribute to the iniquous ends propoſed by the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He anſwers, <hi>Whatever that Licence (as it is called) may be, or may be ſuppoſed to be, when abſtracted from its offenſive circumſtances; yet ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken complexly with theſe circumſtances, it muſt be condemned; and however in our imaginations we may abſtract it from theſe circumſtances, yet we cannot do ſo in point of practice, ſeeing it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that the morality of Actions do much at leaſt depend upon circumſtances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I reply: His firſt anſwer diſtinguiſhes the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Eſtates of Miniſters from their Office and Function, and diſtinguiſheth an Indulgence reſpecting their Perſons and Eſtates from an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence reſpecting their Office and Function; and he grants that an Indulgence reſpecting their Perſons and Eſtates, may be looked on as a meer relaxation of the rigidity of former Edicts, but denies that an Indulgence relating to their Office and Function, can be ſuch a relaxation But I would know what reaſon he can give, why there may not be a meer relaxation of the rigour of Edicts which relate to Miniſters Function, as well as of theſe which relate to their Perſons and Eſtates? there is very good reaſon for diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing the Perſons and Eſtates of Miniſters
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:40126:106"/> from their Functions, and for diſtinguiſhing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences relating to the one, from Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces relating to the other. But he hath given no Reaſon why there may not be a meer relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the rigour of Edicts relating to the one, as well as of Edicts relating to the other. He ſhould not ſo frequently have impoſed on us by his dictates. He might eaſily have perceived, that this was but a blind and toome talk; and I think he hath perceived it after he had written it; and therefore he adds, <hi>That this Indulgence rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to their Function, is deſigned for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an uſurped Power over the Function of the Miniſtry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer: An Indulgence reſpecting Miniſters Perſons and Eſtates, may be deſigned for an ill end; and if the Magiſtrate deſigned it in the one, he deſigned it in the other alſo; now if the Magiſtrates wrong deſign in an Indulgence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Perſons and Eſtates of Miniſters, doth not, and ſhould not hinder the Miniſters to look upon that Indulgence, and make uſe of it as a relaxation of the rigour of the Edicts made againſt their Perſons and Eſtates; why ſhould his ill intention in granting an Indulgence relating to their Function, hinder them from making uſe of it, only as it's a relaxation of the rigour of the Edicts which reſtrained them from the peaceable uſe of their Miniſtry? for the one relaxation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in its ſelf, is as good, if not better than the other; for the free undiſturbed peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry, is preferable to the meer freedom of a Miniſters Perſon, or the free
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:40126:106"/> uſe of his Eſtate; And though the Magiſtrates ill deſign in relaxing, doth vitiate his Act to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, yet it doth not vitiate the Act of him that accepts of the relaxation, and diſapproves the Magiſtrates ill deſign. Although the perſon who gives Alms out of vain glory, or the Magiſtrate who gives a Priſoner liberty, out of an ill deſign, do by their ill deſigns vitiate their own Acts; yet the indigent mans receiving of the Alms, and the Priſoners accepting of his liberty, are not defiled by the ill deſign of the Alms-giver, or the Releaſer of the Priſoner.</p>
               <p>The Author, as it would ſeem, ſuſpecting what he had ſaid to be but looſe-work; therefore to make all ſure, he addeth, <hi>That this Indulgence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth an acquieſcing and ſubmiſſion unto Acts,</hi> &amp;c. But it's manifeſtly falſe, that they acquieſced or ſubmitted to any Acts that eſtabliſhed Eraſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, or any uſurpation; but he hath a way of alledging ſtrongly what he ſhould have proven, but could not do it.</p>
               <p>That which they accepted, was the relaxation; but he will have them to acquieſce in the Acts, he means the complex Acts of the Indulgence; and ſo if ye believe him, they could not but contribute to the iniquous ends propoſed by the Indulgers. Thus ye ſee he makes all as ſure as his words could make it; for if (without reaſon) ye will take things upon truſt from him, they are as he ſays, and they cannot but be as he ſays. Ere I come to his ſecond anſwer, I cannot but take notice of the Confeſſion in his firſt Anſwer.</p>
               <p>The Objection which he pretends to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:40126:107"/> anſwer, ſpeaks of what the Indulged Miniſters accepted; he anſwers of the Magiſtrates Acts and their deſigns in acting; and when he is ſpeaking of the Magiſtrates Acts, he ſays, <hi>That this Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence includeth an acquieſcing and ſubmiſſion,</hi> &amp;c. This muſt, if it hath any ſenſe, be applied to the Act of the Indulged Miniſters; for as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning of the eſtabliſhment in the words imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately preceding, relates to the Magiſtrate; ſo this ſubmiſſion cannot be the Magiſtrates Act. This is very confuſed work! if the Author hath been neceſſitated to ſtudy this Confuſion, to wrap up a matter that could not be diſtinctly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led without diſadvantage to his cauſe, he hath been put upon a pitiful Trade.</p>
               <p>His Anſ. 2. is as confuſed as his firſt. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates Act indulging, conſidered morally, muſt be conſidered with its circumſtances; and he knows that the Indulged Miniſters are far from juſtifying the ſame. But the Miniſters indulged did not accept of thoſe Acts in the complex, but of the relaxation of the reſtraint; they knew how to chuſe what was good, and refuſe the evil. But that which hath deceived this Author, hath been a very odd conceit, <hi>viz. That the Indulged Miniſters could not in their practice accept of the relaxation, and not be involved in the guilt of the Magiſtrates deſign; becauſe the morality of Actions doth much depend upon circumſtances; and the end and deſign is a main circumſtance in conſtituting the morality of an action.</hi> But he was very far out in his morals, if he thought that the morality of one mans action, is conſtituted by another mans deſign.</p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:40126:107"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Titius</hi>'s deſign is extrinſecal to <hi>Sempronius</hi>'s action; another mans bad deſign, if I do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it, doth not vitiate my action.</p>
               <p>I ſhewed before, that a man may make uſe of relaxation from Impriſonment, though he who relaxes him hath a bad deſign in doing it. It's an ill intention in the Agent himſelf that vitiates his action, and not the ill intention of another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whoſe Intention he knows not; or if he knows it to be ill, diſapproves it: it's upon the circumſtances of our own actions, and not upon the circumſtances of other folks actions, that the morality of our actions doth much depend.</p>
               <p>Pag. 98. Sect. 7. After the repetition of what he had ſaid often before, he alledgeth, <hi>That the refuſing of the Indulgence would have been a ſenſible defeating of the deſign of Eraſtianiſm, and would have neceſſitated the deſigners to have taken other meaſures.</hi> And he adds, <hi>That this ſuppoſable defeat, is ſufficient to ſhew how ſuitable a</hi> medium <hi>this was unto the projected end: and that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid, that this is but accidental; for it hath a neceſſary connexion with the end, as not only expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath proven, but the very nature of the thing evinceth, as is abundantly cleared above.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The abſolute refuſal of the relaxation of the reſtraint; or the abſolute refuſal of the peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry, would not have been a right way of defeating Eraſtianiſm. It's a very ordinary fault in theſe times, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing one evil, to run into another. <hi>Dum vitant ſtulti vitia in contraria currunt.</hi> There were ſome, who a little after the Reformation from Popery,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:40126:108"/> in their oppoſing the merit of good works, ran into an oppoſite error, That good works were pernicious to Salvation; this was not a right way of defeating the merit of good works; for this tended rather to harden Papiſts in their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the merit of good works, when they ſaw how abſurd this device was, which ſome had fallen upon to defeat the merit of works. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality is oppoſite to Covetouſneſs; but it is not Gods way to defeat Covetouſneſs, to turn Prodigal: To refuſe the peaceable publick exerciſe of the Miniſtry, and to chuſe and prefer an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry unto the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able exerciſe of it; and to chuſe a way of preaching upon that account that it's contrary unto the Magiſtrates will, as if the Magiſtrates appointment or permiſſion to preach, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with Chriſts call, as the Author ſtates the queſtion, pag. 129. are ſo far from being right means of defeating Eraſtianiſm, that they are rather means to harden <hi>Eraſtians;</hi> for to oppoſe that power which the Magiſtrate hath from God, as if that were an <hi>Eraſtian</hi> power, confirms <hi>Eraſtians,</hi> that they who oppoſe Eraſtianiſm that way op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Ordinance of God; And they who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to take the peaceable publick exerciſe of their Miniſtry under the protection of lawful Authority, but will preach contrary to the Magiſtrates will, need not to think it ſtrange, if the Magiſtrate think and ſay, that ſuch ways and principles as theſe which lead men to an unneceſſary, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceable thwarting with the Magiſtrate, are oppoſite to Civil Authority and lawful peace,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:40126:108"/> and ſo are not of God, who is the God of Order and Peace.</p>
               <p>The Indulged Miniſters made uſe of what in the Indulgence was the exerciſe of that power which the Magiſtrate hath from God; and by this ſhew their reſpect to lawful Authority; and they both by word and practice, did what they judged incumbent to them, to render any evil which was in the complex Acts of the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, ineffectual. So far were they from doing any thing which had a neceſſary connexion with any wrong end; and he hath not yet cleared, that experience or the nature of the thing doth evince what he ſays. I perceive he hath a way of forcing nature, to evince what he cannot prove.</p>
               <p>Pag. 98. We have his ſixth head of Arguments, in which he undertaketh to ſhew how prejudicial this Indulgence is unto the good of the Church. If he would have proven any thing againſt the practice of the Indulged Miniſters, he ſhould have ſhewed that what they did, was prejudicial to the Church. His firſt Hiſt. is not pertinent; the practice of the Indulged Miniſters in returning to their own charges, or going to Pariſhes that were deſtitute, upon the Invitation of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as it doth not make any precedent for thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Miniſters; (for he knew that not long before the Indulgence, not only the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Miniſters, but others were thruſt out) ſo it makes no precedent for Magiſtrates put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Miniſters <hi>brevi manu;</hi> for whatever the Magiſtrate deſigned, yet theſe Miniſters did not enter in theſe Congregations <hi>brevi manu,</hi> as was
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:40126:109"/> cleared before. And I ſuppoſe he will not find in Church-Hiſtory, that the Church was hurt by the Magiſtrates reſtoring or placing Orthodox Miniſters. He granted before, that in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſtate of the Church, Magiſtrates might place Miniſters. If there be any ſtrength in this firſt Argument, it will overturn that conceſſion; for if Magiſtrates may thruſt out Hereticks when the Church is corrupted, and place Orthodox Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; then he will infer, that the ice being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, if the Magiſtrate turn <hi>Arrian,</hi> he will thruſt out Orthodox, and put in Hereticks, and the Orthodox Magiſtrates and Miniſters have paved the way and broken the Ice. The abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities which have followed upon the corruptions of corrupt Magiſtrates doth no more bind up Magiſtrates from doing right, than the abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which have followed upon the corruptions of Corrupt Miniſters doth bind up Miniſters from doing their duty.</p>
               <p>His 2d. as it is no parallel to the caſe in hand, ſo it ſhews that an ill-diſpoſed Eccleſiaſtick Court may miſplant Kirks; and to reaſon from preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices ariſing upon ſuppoſition of mens corruptions, would exclude Miniſters as well as Magiſtrates from having any hand in providing deſolate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. The Miniſters who were Indulged, did not upon the Indulgence leave their own char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, for they were thruſt out of them long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Indulgence; neither did they go to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Congregations upon the Magiſtrates ſole call, as he ſuppoſes; ſo that he is but fighting with his own ſhadow.</p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:40126:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>To his 3d. I need ſay no more but this; if any ſuch emergent fall out in after-times, the carriage of the Indulged Miniſters, if it be rightly repreſented, will not be prejudicial to the Church; if it be miſrepreſented, as it is by this Author, then he, and not the Indulged Miniſters are to be blamed for any ill uſe that any may make of it; if he had been as tender of the Poſterity as he ſhould have been, he would not have ſo miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the practice of many honeſt Miniſters; for he might have thought, that following genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would lay more weight upon the practice of ſo many, than upon his Authory; and that his reaſonings would be no ſufficient Salvo; for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity would ſuppoſe that ſo many able and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencious Miniſters wanted not reaſonings for their practice; and would readily ſuſpect all his reaſonings as not ſolid.</p>
               <p>To his 4th. I anſwer: The practice of the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſters makes no preparative for ſending all Orthodox Miniſters to one ſmall inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able corner of the Land; for he knows that the Indulged Miniſters were not for the unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary thruſting in of many Miniſters into one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. If the Magiſtrate by force did thruſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Miniſters not only to the High-lands, but out of the Land; I think it were unreaſonable to blame the Indulged Miniſters, for that Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates know well enough the way of confining and baniſhing Miniſters that they would have been quit of many ages ago. Miniſters going to <hi>Holland</hi> when they are baniſhed, may have the ſame conſequences that Miniſters going to the High-lands may have.</p>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:40126:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>To his 5th. I anſwer: The caſe of theſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters who in the ſecond Indulgence were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to preach in Congregations which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready provided, was not the ſame with the caſe of theſe who were invited by the people to come and help Congregations which were deſtitute. And as the Miniſters who are not Indulged, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute for the general good of the Church when they preach as they have acceſs, now in one place and then in another (for they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not preach to the whole Church at once) ſo do the Indulged Miniſters contribute for the good of the Church when they help theſe Congregations where they are ſetled; and their ſettlement, as was ſaid before, puts them in a better capacity to take inſpection of the flock, than if they were not ſetled; and their preaching in theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations does not hinder Miniſters who are not Indulged, to preach elſewhere as they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. The Indulged Miniſters did not pretend to be the only doers of the duty of the day, but they did a part of the duty of the day, and they are glad of the ſucceſs of the Miniſtry of thoſe who were not Indulged; and wiſh that it were as great as it is called by him in his Sect. 6. To which I need ſay no more but theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">I. That as the Indulged Miniſters had no deſign to deprive the Lords people of the benefit of the Miniſtry of Miniſters not Indulged; ſo their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice did no way tend to the hinderance of the exerciſe of their Miniſtry either in houſes or fields, no more than the preaching of one Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter not Indulged in one Pariſh, did hinder the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:40126:110"/> preaching of another Miniſter not Indulged in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Pariſh.</p>
               <p n="2">II. There hath been much more preaching of the Goſpel in all places where people were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hear, ſince the Indulgence than before.</p>
               <p n="3">III. In all appearance, an utter refuſal to have made any uſe of the Indulgence, would have been a greater obſtruction of preaching and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and given greater colour for obſtruction than any thing which he alledgeth upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Miniſters.</p>
               <p>As for his 7th. about Stipends, we had enough of that before. It ſeems he hath laid great ſtreſs upon this buſineſs of Stipends; for he ſays, <hi>The hurt and prejudice by this bondage in the matter of Stipends, is inexpreſſible.</hi> He refers to his 4th. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark in the Kings Letter, where there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things cited from Scripture, and the ſecond Book of Diſcipline, about Stipends, which the Indulged Miniſters know as well as he; but what remedy preſcribes he? He thinks this was ground enough to have refuſed the favour. Surely this tale would have told very ill before the Council; We will not preach except we get the Stipend at our own diſpoſal. Again, he ſpeaks as if the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters had been in equal terms with the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and had had poſſeſſion of the Stipends, and had alienate them by their conſent; whereas the truth was, they were and had been for ſeveral years thruſt from Kirks and Stipends. I think the Indulged Miniſters did much better, and that which was more becoming men of their ſtation, who made no mention of the Stipends at all.
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:40126:111"/> His next overture is, he would have had them chuſing rather to preach <hi>gratis,</hi> than any way to have contributed to the laying on of ſuch a yoke upon the neck of the Church of <hi>Scotland;</hi> but that yoke was on already; and their refuſing to take the Stipend of the Church where they preached, had been to contribute to that ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which is mentioned in the place of the 2d. Book of Diſcipline which he cites; for thus the whole of the Stipend would have been quit and alienate to another uſe than that to which it was dedicated. The freedom and faithfulneſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencious Miniſters, will be no more obſtructed by receiving what the Magiſtrates thinks fit to give, than by receiving what people think fit to give; and they who are not conſciencious, will be as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by their dependance upon the people, as upon the Magiſtrate. Pag. 100. Sect. 8. He ſays, <hi>The Indulged Miniſters became wholly ſubject to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, even in all matters Eccleſiaſtick, whether concerning Doctrine, Diſcipline or manners, as being accountable only to them, and wholly at their devotion.</hi> I anſwer, This is a bundle of untruths, and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious falſe aſperſions. That the Indulged Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters cannot get ſtayed longer than the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate will ſuffer them, is common to them with all the Miniſters of the World where there are Magiſtrates who have a coercive power, by which they can impriſon, baniſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He himſelf and the Author of the Epiſtle to the Reader, could ſtay no longer in <hi>Rotterdam</hi> than the Magiſtrate pleaſed; as for that couping from Kirk to Kirk which he ſpeaks of, as if it had been meerly upon
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:40126:111"/> the Magiſtrates pleaſure, it will I ſuppoſe upon trial be found an injurious aſperſion; if a Miniſter hath upon the Invitation of a vacant congregation, where he might to the greater good of the Church, and with the conſent of the Miniſters of the bounds, reſpectively concerned, removed from one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to another; this will not be found pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial, but advantageous to the Church.</p>
               <p>As for his Sect. 9. we have often before ſpoken of the Inſtructions. After he hath ſaid what he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of a baſe, ſinful compacting, which to him is the baſeſt <hi>Symony,</hi> and taking of liberty upon ſinful conditions; He ſays, <hi>he knows the Indulged Miniſters will ſay they are free of compacting.</hi> And he dare not gainſay; for he comes off with this faint; <hi>and I ſhall not accuſe them further than I know or have ground;</hi> but he tells us for certain, That the Inſtructions were in the Kings Letter, and that the Council calls them terms. He knows the Indulged Miniſters could not hinder the Kings Secretary, or the Councils Clerks to write what the King or Council thought fit; but he ſays, <hi>They who were called before the Council</hi> 1673. <hi>did not expreſs their diſſatisfaction with theſe terms, ſo as to quit the benefit, and caſt the bargain thereupon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> He would, I perceive, have had the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſters upon all accuſations, quitting the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry; but though they did not think it their duty to do that, yet I wonder how he can ſay, That they expreſſed not their diſſatisfaction with theſe Inſtructions; for we heard before, that Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> gave an honeſt and faithful Teſtimony againſt theſe Inſtructions,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:40126:112"/> and that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſpoke the ſame upon the matter which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſpoke; this the Author himſelf ſaith and proveth: but enough of this before.</p>
               <p>His Sect. 10. Suppoſes that they ſubjected themſelves to the Councils Inſtructions to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry; and hence he infers, that they became as formally ſubject to the Magiſtrate in matters Eccleſiaſtick, as any inferior Civil Officers, ſuch as Sheriffs, Juſtices of Peace, Baylifs. I anſwer: He ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes what he ſhould prove; if we yield him his falſe <hi>poſtulata,</hi> and give him leave to ſuppoſe what he pleaſes, he may no doubt do great feats, and elect a world of abſurdities out of one falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit; but though he will readily get many ſimple ones that believe every word, to believe him, yet I ſuppoſe no perſon that is judicious, will belive ſo grievous an accuſation againſt ſo many Miniſters of Chriſt without proof; if we muſt not receive an accuſation againſt an Elder, but under two or three Witneſſes, much leſs muſt we receive an accuſation againſt ſo many Elders upon the meer word of the Accuſers, though they were never ſo many; and much leſs upon the word of one Accuſer.</p>
               <p>In his Sect. 11. he quarrels with the Indulged Miniſters, <hi>becauſe of the want of the free and full exerciſe of Diſcipline, and that in the lawful Courts of Chriſt; and that they diſpence calmly with the want of Church-Diſcipline in Presbyteries and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. As I ſaid before, this is to quarrel againſt the holy Providence of God.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:40126:112"/>2. They wanted theſe before they were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They may <hi>ſub cruce</hi> and <hi>cum periculo</hi> keep Presbyteries and Synods, notwithſtanding of the Indulgence.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Kirk-Seſſions are one of the Courts of Chriſt, and one is better than none. He excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Non-indulged though they have no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline, <hi>becauſe all their preaching is</hi> ſub cruce, <hi>not having ſo much as freedom to exerciſe any part of their Miniſtry, and ſo are allowed of God to do all they can, when they cannot do all they would.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The Author hath here forgot himſelf, and the quarrel he had againſt Mr. <hi>H.</hi> for acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the Magiſtrates granting of the liberty of the publick exerciſe of the Miniſtry; as if he had thereby acknowledged, That they had the exerciſe of their Miniſtry from the Magiſtrate; but if Mr. <hi>H.</hi> had uſed ſuch words as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor doth when he ſpeaks of the Non-Indulged, <hi>who,</hi> as he ſays, <hi>have not ſo much as freedom to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe any part of their Miniſtry;</hi> O what out-crying ſhould we have heard, when he makes ſuch a noiſe about Mr. <hi>H's.</hi> words! though he not only adds liberty and freedom, but alſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, to the exerciſe of the Miniſtry; and ſubjoyns, <hi>after ſo long a reſtraint, and under the protection of lawful Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>H.</hi> had ſaid in the words of this Author, <hi>My Lords, whereas ſince we were turned out, we had not ſo much as freedom to exerciſe any part of our Miniſtry; but now we have freedom to exerciſe our Miniſtry,</hi> &amp;c. What Commentaries and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:40126:113"/> would have been made upon and out of theſe words! Now if the Non-indulged want the freedom to exerciſe any part of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, is it not by the penal Statutes, that they are deprived of this freedom? were it not an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to have this freedom which they want? and this they cannot have without the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; and why may they not accept of this freedom from the Magiſtrate? and if they may, what ails the Author at the Indulged Miniſters for the accepting of that freedom which they wanted?</p>
               <p n="2">2. He deals not equally with the Indulged and Non-indulged; <hi>The Non-indulged are,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>allowed of God to do all they can, ſeeing they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do as they would;</hi> but he would have the Indulged Miniſters do more than they can. He would have the Indulged Miniſters keeping Presbyteries and Synods, which they can no more do without hazard, than the Non-indulged; yea, their hazard would be much greater than the hazard of the Non-indulged; for the Magiſtrate would know where to find them if they had a mind to take them; or if they cited them, they behoved either to appear or to loſe the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry, which the Non-indulged have not, and ſo cannot loſe. His tacite inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation that the Indulged are not countenanced in the exerciſe of Diſcipline and Preaching, as the Ambaſſadours of Chriſt; and his aſſerting that they are under the Leeſheet of the Supremacy, as if they acknowledged any <hi>Eraſtian</hi> or abſolute Supremacy in the Magiſtrate in Eccleſiaſtical
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:40126:113"/> matters, and his reflection on the conſtitution and guiding of ſome of their Seſſions, are a new ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to his former unproven and ill-grounded alledgances.</p>
               <p>As for his 12. the Indulged Miniſters <hi>cum pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riculo,</hi> as well as the Non-indulged, ordain Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, they have accepted of no terms to inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitate them for Ordination. But this would not ſatisfie this Author, except they did relinquiſh the Indulgence, and betake themſelves to the fields; but we ſaw before, why nothing but the fields will pleaſe this Author.</p>
               <p>Pag. 101. We have his 7th. head of Arguments. He alledgeth, <hi>That the Indulged Miniſters have ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped off in ſuch a way as cannot but be accounted a falling off from the cauſe and ground of our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> We have anſwered already theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whereby he would prove this alledgance in his firſt ſeven Sections. His 8. Section makes much againſt him, and for the Indulged Miniſters, as we ſaw before. As for his 9th. it's no new thing to ſee Miniſters compearing before the Council; the firſt Book of Diſcipline was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by Miniſters to the Council, which was much more than compearance.</p>
               <p>He ſuppoſes the Indulged to have accepted the inſtructions; but it's a falſe ſuppoſition, as hath been before cleared. If he will make a parallel caſe (either in the year 1649. or any year he pleaſeth;) the Indulged Miniſters are content to leave to all who are fit to judge of matters of this nature, to judge concerning their practice. As for the Hiſtory which is in his 10. he ſpeaks as if
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:40126:114"/> the Indulged Miniſters generally had ſaid, they had not ſeen theſe inſtructions, which is very falſe. His 11th. He indefinitely charges the Indulged Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters with laying aſide the Lecture, which is another falſhood; That any of them who do not Lecture, have forſaken it upon the command of the Council, is another of his groundleſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgances; as ſome few of the indulged Miniſters, ſo ſeveral of the not-indulged do not lecture. But I hope he will not ſay, That it's the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Council, that they forbear it: They have other Reaſons; ſome found themſelves not able to lecture and preach twice on the Lords day. His 12th. is reſumed in his 8 head of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, pag. 104. where he undertakes to prove, <hi>That the hands of Prelates are ſtrengthened by the Indulgence</hi> The Prelates, I ſuppoſe, are not of that mind themſelves. Firſt, ſaith he, <hi>not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the open door that is left to them to accept of the Prelates Collation, nor the encouragement they have to ſeek and obtain.</hi> He did well not to mention this; for it is not worth the mentioning. It's falſe, That the indulged Miniſters put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in priſon under the Biſhops lock and key. As for his ſecond, the Churches where the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſters are ſetled, are not encumbred with thoſe who own Prelacy, as they were before the Indulgence, which is no ſmall diſadvantage to Prelacy.</p>
               <p>It's a falſe alledgance, That the indulged Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters were content that their Miniſtry ſhould be confined within limited places, let the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church be what it would or could be;
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:40126:114"/> how knows he that the indulged Miniſters would not deny to help people that are deſtitute in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, if they ſaw that the neceſſity of the Church did require it? It would be a prejudice, and no advantage to the Church, needleſly to leave the charges where they are ſetled, and to leave the Congregations where they are, to be planted with Conformiſts.</p>
               <p>His third Section, in which he alledgeth the friendly and brotherly love and correſpondence betwixt ſome of the indulged and Neighbour-hirelings, and the want of Zeal againſt Prelates wherever the Indulgence is, is grounded upon miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>information. That Prelates will poſſibly ſay, That one Field-Conventicle hath done them and their cauſe more prejudice than many preachings of all the indulged men, is another of his ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>His 5th. ſuppoſes that they have accepted of the Inſtructions, which is a falſe ſuppoſition, and before refuted. The paying of money to the Clerks, in his Parentheſis pag. 106. was not worth the mentioning. Theſe Clerks ſeek it not by the Prelates Authority, but upon the Councils ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, backed with charges of horning; and whether it be rather eligible to pay a little mony, or to be put to the horn and taken with caption, let any ſober perſon judge. The ſcruples that the Author and ſome others have put in the peoples heads about paying of Stipends to the Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts and Seſſors, have waſted ſome peoples E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and tends to waſte their Conſciences; for when they are quartered on, and eaten up, and plundered, they are driven to do what they thought ſinful; and this diſpoſes them to do things that are truly ſinful upon temptations; and when they are by neceſſity driven to pay, they who wait for their halting, alledge they have no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and if they were put to it in other things, they would do all that would be required of them.</p>
               <p>Pag. 106. we have his 9th. head of Arguments, in which he undertakes to prove, That the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Indulgence is againſt our Covenants; but he hath not proven either here or elſewhere, That the Practice of the indulged Miniſters, was a breach of Covenant.</p>
               <p>The Particulars which he brings to prove this charge, have been all refuted above; and it's
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:40126:115"/> needleſs, and would be tedious to the Reader to repeat the ſame things. For what he ſaith page 107. in his fifth Section, of the deſign of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgers to divide, though it were proven, it would make nothing againſt the practice of the indulged Miniſters; for what they did, did no ways tend to diviſion. They declared themſelves before the Council to be of the ſame Judgment they were of before; and they ſtill preach the ſame Doctrine, are for the ſame Worſhip, Diſcipline, Government. They are againſt Popery, Prelacy, Error, Schiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they were before the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence. The Covenant obliges to continue in adhering to the good things, and oppoſing the evils mentioned in it; but does not oblige the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters that they ſhall accept of no favour, or of a righting of any wrong done to them, except they get all the ſame favour and right done to them at the ſame time; but I remember I ſpoke of this before.</p>
               <p>Pag. 107. We have his 10th head of Arguments, where he undertakes to prove, <hi>That the indulged Miniſters condemn themſelves.</hi> His firſt particular to prove this, is falſe; the indulged Miniſters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of the relaxation of the Civil Reſtraint, does not condemn either field or houſe-meetings. In his ſecond he grants, <hi>That all the Indulged Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters except one, condemn the Supremacy as an uſurpation; but,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they have accepted that which purely floweth from the Supremacy;</hi> and refers to his third head of Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This one whom he excepts, if he had been alive, would have anſwered for himſelf; but ſeeing he is at reſt, I am obliged to do him
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:40126:116" rendition="simple:additions"/> right, in ſhewing what was his ſenſe of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy; and I ſhall the rather do it, becauſe the Author of the <hi>Cup of cold Water</hi> ſays, <hi>He hath beat his brains to ſhape a beautiful Mask for the Supremacy, and to put a ſufferable ſenſe upon it, and ſeeks to ſeat the eyes of others.</hi> The Author of the <hi>Cup of cold Water</hi> caſts him as no Seer; and not only rejects him from being the man of his Counſel, but directs all the ſervants and people of God to ſtand aloof from him, as one who ſtands not in the Counſel of God; who will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, pervert and inſnare, whoſe breath is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious, and whoſe ſpeech bewrays him to have the botch of the Court-Creed running upon him. Thus he Stigmatizes, depoſes and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates him; <hi>ſatis pro imperio quiſquis es.</hi> It ſeems the Author of the <hi>Cup of cold Water</hi> hath neither known that Miniſter, nor yet his opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Supremacy, and ſo he hath ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ruſhed into a multitude of abſurdities. The Miniſter whom he thus abuſes, was a godly, able, painful Miniſter of the Goſpel; and his memory is ſavoury to thoſe who were acquainted with him; he was well verſed in Polemick Divinity, a man who would not be affrighted or boaſted with toome empty words. I think I ſee how he would have ſmiled at the Author of the <hi>Cup of cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Eccho; alas! it was not <hi>Eccho's,</hi> but <hi>Ergo's</hi> which he regarded; it was not empty ſounds, whether direct or reflex, but ſound Reaſon which would have prevailed with him.</p>
               <p>As for his ſingular opinion, it is true, in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the <hi>Countrymans Scruples,</hi> he declares,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:40126:116"/> That he doth not think the Supremacy claimed by the Magiſtrate, to be a ſpiritual Supremacy; and gives ſeveral Reaſons why he conceives it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expounded in that ſenſe; but it's as true, that he is ſo far from putting a beautiful Mask upon the Supremacy, That he declares this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power eſtabliſhed in the King and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, to do what they will in Church-affairs, without either Council or Parliament, is and will be matter of aſtoniſhment; and that the Act of eſtabliſhing it, is more dangerous than if it did eſtabliſh Eraſtianiſm or the ſpiritual Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy. And the Reaſon of this is clear, becauſe although <hi>Eraſtus'</hi> did abſurdly imagine, That the Magiſtrate might himſelf exerciſe Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Functions, or imploy others to exerciſe theſe Functions in his name; yet he was ſo far from thinking that the Magiſtrate might diſpoſe upon, and order things ſacred according to his pleaſure, that he hath often declared, That he ought to order things ſacred according to the preſcription of the word of God.</p>
               <p>In his anſwer to <hi>Beza,</hi> pag. 125. of that Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion printed at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> Anno 1649. after he hath aſcribed all the Government of the Church to the Magiſtrate, he adds, <hi>Yet as in taking the care of things profane, it is not lawful to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to paſs the bounds of Equity, Juſtice, and Honeſty; that is the preſcription of the Laws and Statutes of the Common-wealth: ſo in diſpoſing and ordering things ſacred, or things pertaining to the worſhip of God, it is far leſs lawful for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate in any part to depart from the Preſcription
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:40126:117" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the word of God, which he ought to follow as a rule in all things, and never to decline from it, even in a hairs breadth. Whereas by this Act of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy</hi> (ſaith the Miniſter who anſwered the <hi>Countrymans Scruples) a King, if he will, may bring in Popery, yea, overturn all Religion, without conſent either of Council or Parliament, as we may ſee in the example of</hi> Jeroboam, <hi>who cauſed</hi> Iſrael <hi>to ſin, by ſetting up a Worſhip of his own deviſing.</hi> Is this a beautiful mask, ſhaped for the Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy? the Author of the <hi>Cup of cold Water</hi> ſhould be aſhamed and humbled for theſe abſurdities, that through miſinformation he hath run into: is it not ſtrange, that one Miniſter ſo ill informed, while he is inveighing againſt the ſupremacy, ſhould act as if he had a Papal Supremacy, in ſtigmatizing, depoſing, excommunicating his fellow-ſervant? But I perceive the truth of that ſaying, That man will much ſooner ſee a Pope in another mans belly, than when he is in his own. That ſaithful Miniſter was ſeeing light in light, when the Author of the <hi>Cup of cold Water</hi> did judge him no ſeer; he was admitted to the fellowſhip of the Saints in Heaven, before this Sentence of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was paſt on earth. He was drinking of the pure river of the water of life, when this foul, and not cold, but ſcalding hot water was caſt at him out of this <hi>Cup of cold Water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Author hath verified what the Poet thought impoſſible, <hi>Unda dabit flammas.</hi> I wiſh the other part of the verſe, <hi>&amp; dabit ignis aquas,</hi> may alſo be verified, that ſuch flaſhes of fire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the wrath of man, might be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:40126:117" rendition="simple:additions"/> into theſe waters that the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> wiſhes for, and be reſolved in tears of godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Having diſcovered the wrong which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Cup of cold Water,</hi> and the Author of this Hiſtory have done to that one indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: I anſwer, Secondly, That which the Author of the Hiſtory of the Indulgence ſubſumes, That the indulged Miniſters accepted of that which purely flowed from that Supremacy which they count an uſurpation, is falſe and a begging of the queſtion; as he refers to the 3d. head, I refer to the anſwer to it before given. His third, <hi>That the entry is founded upon any ſinful Supremacy,</hi> is alſo falſe. To his 4th. concerning the Patrons, we ſpoke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For his 5th. after he hath repeated that the indulged Miniſters did receive the Inſtructions, which is a falſe alledgance, as we have cleared from Mr. <hi>H's</hi> Speech; and what was ſpoken by the indulged Miniſters who were called before the Council for not keeping the 29th. of <hi>May,</hi> and from the Authors own confeſſion, who grants that they did not obey theſe injunctions, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges that they gave an honeſt Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny againſt them; he draws a parallel, whereby he thinks it may diſtinctly appear, that their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of the benefit offered by the accommodation, did condemn their accepting of the benefit offered by the Indulgence; but he is here as far out in his Mathematicks, as we have found him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out in his Morals and Logicks.</p>
               <p>The acceptance of the relaxation of the civil reſtraint, which impeded the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry, hath no proportion with, or
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:40126:118" rendition="simple:additions"/> equality unto the acceptance of the Propoſals made by Biſhop <hi>Lighton</hi> for accommodation; for the acceptance of theſe propoſals had been the accepting of a wrong form and model of Church-government. In that Model of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment offered in theſe Propoſals, there is an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer ſet up, a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Biſhop, who is not in the Rolls of Church-Officers recorded in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; a Preſident impoſed upon, not freely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by the Synod, not countable to, nor cenſurable by the Synod, claiming power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain not only ſingle Presbyters, but Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries from the exerciſe of that Authority which they have received from Chriſt for the Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church; Who can reſtrain a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery from ordaining a Miniſter; though the Church who hath elected him, be moſt earneſt to have him ordained, the perſon elected be moſt fit for the charge, and the Presbytery moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to ordain. The Synod is mangled in its members, wanting ruling Elders, manacled is its power, not being free to chuſe its own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator, nor to cenſure the impoſed Preſident, though he were moſt culpable and unworthy of his place.</p>
               <p>The propoſals overturns the identity of Biſhop and Presbyter; for in them not only is Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction made betwixt the Biſhop and Presbyter, but the Biſhop is made Superior to the Presbytery, they deſtroy the parity of Miniſters, and the ſubjection of the part to the whole: what the Provincial Synod would have been, who could tell? but it's like it would be leſs than the <hi>Dioceſon;</hi>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:40126:118"/> and yet this behoved to be ſubject to that. The accepting of theſe Propoſals, and entering into, and concurring with Meetings thus corruptly conſtituted, had been a real conſenting to own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſetling, eſtabliſhing, promoving this corrupt conſtitution of Government; and no verbal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of their diſſatisfaction with the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the conſtitution, could have ſalved the matter; for their voluntary conſtituting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves members of a Court, ſo corruptly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, and concurring with the Biſhop while he was exerciſing his Prelatical Power (for if he exerciſe it any where, it is in the <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods) had been contrary to their verbal Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and whatever they ſaid contrary to the Biſhops uſurpation, or the corrupt conſtitution of the Court, their deed would have effectively and moſt effectually eſtabliſhed that corrupt form of Church-government, and rendered their words ineffectual and ridiculous.</p>
               <p>The moſt effectual way of eſtabliſhing an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper, is to concur with him in his Courts, and act in a forinſick ſubordination to him. Now the indulged Miniſters in accepting the relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo often ſpoken of, did neither verbally, nor really acknowledge, own or eſtabliſh any uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Council. The Author ſays, <hi>That their deed was a manifeſt complyance with Eraſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm;</hi> but this is falſe, as hath been before cleared; and thus he goeth about to make their accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the relaxation of the Civil reſtraint, which is in it ſelf a ſtraight line, crooked, that it might run parallel to the crooked line of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:40126:119"/> compliance with Prelacy; but this was a fault in morality, whatever it was in the Mathematicks. His firſt ſix parallels, and his ſecond ſix parallels, are nothing to his purpoſe, except ye let him have his concluſion by begging, in granting that the practice of the indulged Miniſters was an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of, or a compliance with Eraſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm; Mathematicians uſes to demonſtrate, and not to beg the queſtion. The Author wanted not will to have made a Demonſtration, but the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would not work for him.</p>
               <p>He hath another parallel in the ſixth, where he compares the acceptance of the Indulgence with the taking of the Collation; and firſt he tells us what the taker of Collation, and the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the Indulgence may think; and then he tells us what both of them really does. The taker of the Collation acknowledgeth and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth the Prelate as a Miniſter of Chriſt. <hi>So,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>he who ſubmitteth to the Indulgence, acknowledgeth the Magiſtrate or the Council to be the proper ſubject of formal Church-power;</hi> he ſhould have proven that the acceptance of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> imports any ſuch acknowledgment; but it was eaſier to take it for granted, than to prove it.</p>
               <p>In his third he tells us, there is in the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence a formal acceptance; but he tells us not of what; <hi>and,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>a plain ſubmiſſion;</hi> but he tells us not to what; and a Recognizance, but he tells not of what; and a ſignificant tranſaction, but he tells not about what. It appears by the Parentheſis that follows, <hi>viz.</hi> (if the Council
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:40126:119"/> be to be believed) that as he durſt not before charge the indulged Miniſters with a compact, ſo here he only alledges a tranſaction; but he is not ſure, as his Parentheſis imports.</p>
               <p>As for his 4th. he knows that Presbyterians make a great difference betwixt the Magiſtrate and a Prelate; but of this before. And then it's falſe, That the indulged Miniſters looked upon themſelves as Miniſters of theſe Pariſhes, upon the ſole ground of the Magiſtrates Act. And thus we have done with his parallels, which are meer Paralogiſms: If the matter could have afforded better Arguments, the Author would have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily hit upon them; but the ſubject-matter could not be formed in a Mathematical Demonſtration; <hi>ex quovis ligno non fit Mercurius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pag. 110. we have his eleventh head of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, in which he undertakes to prove, That by the accepting of the Indulgence, the meetings of Gods people are prejudged; he means the meetings nicknamed Conventicles; and he alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <hi>That by the acceping of the Indulgence, they have contributed to the ſuppreſſing of theſe Meetings; and that interpretatively they may he charged in part with the ſeverities exerciſed againſt the ſame.</hi> He only pretends to make this probable and likely, and that this head of Arguments deſerves ſome conſideration; ſo that the Arguments under this head, are not in his own opinion Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but only topical Arguments.</p>
               <p>The Author ſpeaks much more ſoberly here, than he did in the Letters which he ſent before this printed Book; for in that Letter which he
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:40126:120" rendition="simple:additions"/> wrote to a young man, who preached at <hi>Wamfroy,</hi> he ſays, <hi>That the accepters of the Indulgence could not but homologate before the Lord the Magiſtrates deſign to ſuppreſs theſe Meetings of the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and contribute to the carrying on of that end;</hi> and in another Letter he infers, <hi>That ſeeing the Magiſtrate had the ſame deſign in the Indulgence that he had in the band, that therefore the band and Indulgence are of a piece, and that there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference as to kind, betwixt the making uſe of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, and the taking off the band; Though there be a</hi> magis <hi>and</hi> minus, <hi>that may be yielded; yet there is nothing that can alter the kind; nor can he ſee how thoſe who are favourable to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence can, ſpeaking conſequently, condemn the taking of the Band.</hi> Here is very great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, but it's very groundleſs; for ſuppoſe the deſign of all that had a hand in the contriving of the Indulgence, were as ill as he could imagine, yet their deſign could not vitiate the acceptance of the peaceable exerciſe of the preaching of the Goſpel, nor vitiate the hearing of the Goſpel to thoſe who preach and hear the Goſpel, for that end for which God hath appointed it to be preached and heard.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whatever was the intention of the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Indulgence, the preaching of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Miniſters had no more tendency to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der other Miniſters to preach the Goſpel, than the preaching of one Miniſter who is not indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, hinders the preaching of another Miniſter; and experience hath proven this, That their preaching hindred others to preach; for ſeveral
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:40126:120"/> Non-indulged preached more ſince the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence than before.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He gives a ſtrange efficacy to the Magiſtrates intention, in ſaying, <hi>That it makes the making uſe of the Indulgence and taking of the band, to be of a peice, and of one kind;</hi> for the band which he ſpeaks of, obliges to conform to Prelacy, and to caſt off the outed Miniſters, yea, and ſhut up their bowels from them in their diſtreſs; and the perſon who takes it, declares Conventicles to be diſorderly, and the walking according to the Law which eſtabliſhes Prelacy, to be orderly walking.</p>
               <p>They who think that the Magiſtrates inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can make theſe things contained in that band to be of a piece, and of the ſame kind with the peaceable exerciſe of preaching the Goſpel, they give the Magiſtrate a power of working Miracles, in changing the nature of things by his intention, which is more than hath been given to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates by thoſe who talk higheſt of their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy.</p>
               <p>I wiſh he had forborn that expreſſion of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologating before the Lord; for it ſeems to be a taking of the name of God in vain.</p>
               <p>Pag. 111. he deſires us to ponder ſome Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; for the firſt about Magiſtrates deſign, we have weighed it, and found it light. For his ſecond, he ſhould have proven, That it is the neceſſary work of the indulged Miniſters who have Churches to preach in, where the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Lords people are not diſturbed, to leave theſe Churches, and go to preach in
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:40126:121"/> mountains, and needleſly expoſe themſelves to hazard, when they may have the ſame ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God in the Church, and with theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, That they have the accommodation of a houſe to ſhelter them from ſtorms, that they are rid of the fears of Invaſion by armed ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers which do much diſorder folks Spirits for the worſhip of God; and the place of meeting being fixed and known, peoples uncertain wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring upon the Lords day is prevented.</p>
               <p>It hath been very ſad to thoſe who truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to ſanctifie the Sabbath, to wander on the Lords day, to ſeek the word of God and not find it; and when they had found it, to be in a continual fear of violence; or to be fleeing, or to ſee ſome more taken up in drawing themſelves up for fighting, than for drawing near to God; or to ſee or hear of blood mingled with Sacrifices. He ſhould have proven that God calls the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſters to quit the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry in theſe Pariſhes where they are ſetled; where they have opportunity to know the State, Caſe and Way of the people, and to apply their Doctrine ſutably to the peoples Condition; and where they have opportunity to make full proof of their Miniſtry, in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and miniſtring Sacraments, Catechiſing, viſiting, exerciſing Church-Diſcipline.</p>
               <p>The indulged Miniſters are not convinced, That it's the greater good of the Church to caſt theſe Congregations where they are deſolate, and leave them to be filled with Conformiſts. He ſays, <hi>the Indulged Miniſters have given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:40126:121"/> to reſt under the covering of the Supremacy.</hi> This was an invidious and falſe aſperſion; if the giving of themſelves to the work of the Miniſtry, be a giving of themſelves to reſt; then they have given themſelves to reſt. Thinks he that men cannot labour in the work of the Goſpel, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they carry the Goſpel from mountain to hill? Inſtead of the covering of the Supremacy, he ſhould have ſaid, Under the protection of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority; and as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſaid before the Council, The exerciſe of the Miniſtry under the protection of lawful Authority, is one of the moſt deſirable things on earth to Miniſters of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>To his third, The caſe of theſe Miniſters, who were confined to Congregations where there were Miniſters ſetled and permitted to preach <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To his 5th. in which he ſays, <hi>That all the people of theſe Pariſhes where indulged Miniſters are, have been withheld or withdrawn from waiting upon the Lord, at theſe bleſſed and wonderfully countenanced occaſions; whereby the followers of the Lord are broken, divided, and weakened, and ſo become a more ready prey to the Adverſary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, It were to be wiſhed, That the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of theſe occaſions had been really as great as it was called; many who had no prejudice againſt, but loved theſe occaſions, have found by ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that all was not Gold that gliſtered; and ſo many people who for a time ran to theſe occaſions, have by their practiſes, which are not ſutable to the Goſpel, confirmed the ſad truths which outed Miniſters who heard of, or obſerved their way, preached to them; and they have too much verified the fearful apprehenſions that they had concerning them, and the tendency of their way. There were ſome obſerved, That they did not find the people who withdrew from indulged Miniſters, any whit better, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their knowledge, or in their Converſation, by their withdrawing; but ſeveral of them to decline in both, and to become more vain and cenſorious, and addicted to evil-ſpeaking. The people who did not withdraw from the Indulged Miniſters, are very unjuſtly charged with dividing. If they who attended the Ordinances of the Lord diſpenced by indulged Miniſters, were following
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:40126:122"/> the Lord in doing ſo, then by their attendance they did not break off from the followers of the Lord.</p>
               <p>To his 6th. I have anſwered in ſpeaking to his 4th. There is greater probability of ſad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that would have followed upon an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute refuſal of making any uſe of the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, than there is of theſe good conſequences which he imagines would have followed upon the refuſal of it.</p>
               <p>His 7th. is a meer begging of the queſtion; and ſo is his 8th. For the indulged Minſters have not expoſed other Miniſters who are not indulged, to any cruelties or barbarities. I perceive by his way of reaſoning, if the Council had a little after the Act of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> retracted that Act, and have given all theſe Miniſters liberty to return to their ſeveral Pariſhes; if they had excepted but one or two, this Author could not have allowed of their return; for he would have interpreted this to be an expoſing of thoſe who were excepted, to the fury of Adverſaries, and would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned them as guilty of all the cruelties which the excepted perſons might meet with. By the ſame reaſon priſoners impriſoned for the truth, might not accept of freedom from priſon, except they were all releaſed at once; by this means one wilful man who would refuſe to accept of liberty from priſon upon very honeſt and juſt terms, might keep a hundred or thouſand who had free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to accept of releaſe upon ſuch honeſt and juſt terms; I ſay this one might keep them all in pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>His 12th. and laſt head of Arguments againſt the accepting of the Indulgence, as taken from the real ground of offence, which he alledges was in the accepting of the Indulgence, and the ſcandal that was thereby given to one and other: And this he ſaith, <hi>is valid enough alone to militate againſt it, and ſufficient to condemn it unto all who underſtand the nature of ſcandal; and the dreadfulneſs of the ſin of giving ſcandal by any thing we do, whether as to matter or manner; and who remember what Chriſt and his Apoſtles have ſaid of this.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The <hi>all</hi> who underſtand the nature of ſcandal, are not ſo <hi>many</hi> as it ſeems the Author hath imagined; the greateſt Divines, who have ſearched moſt into the nature of Scandal, have found it very intricate and obſcure.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> in his diſpute touching Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal and Chriſtian liberty, ſubjoyned to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right of Church-government, pag. 81. ſaith, <hi>That the Doctrine of Scandal is more intricate and obſcure than every Divine conceives. If folk would forbear to condemn the practiſes of others as ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, until they underſtood the nature of Scandal, there would be much leſs Scandal in the World than there is; there are many who give Scandal by calling theſe things ſcandalous which are not ſcandalous. It's a grievous ſin, though many be not aware of it, to add to the word of God, in making more ſins, and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſins, than they can prove to be ſins or ſcandalous ſins from the perfect rule of the word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> ſhews in the forecited diſpute, That many alledged, <hi>That there was Scandal given by telling of Bells, and Miniſters preaching in a

There is no way</hi> (ſaith the Author) <hi>to evite the force of this Argument, but by affirming and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Action at which the offence is taken, or may be taken, is not only lawful in it ſelf, but as circumſtantial, is expedient and neceſſary to be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Aurhor ſhould, if he would have ſaid any thing to the purpoſe, have proven, or at leaſt endeavoured to have proven, that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of the peaceable exerciſe of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry under the protection of lawful Authority; or which is all one, the acceptance of the Relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Civil reſtraint which had ſo long reſtrained the publick exerciſe of the Miniſtry, That this acceptance did give offence, or was of it ſelf an occaſion of ſtumbling or ruine; or that it was inductive to ſin.

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:40126:124"/> proper grounds and midſes which prove this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency and neceſſity. Suppoſe ſome did now take offence at the eating of Swines-fleſh or blood, though the perſon who eated blood, could not prove the expediency or neceſſity of his eating Swines-fleſh or blood, yet the offence would be taken, and not given; and it were incumbent to the perſon that took offence, to prove that the eating of Swines-fleſh and blood were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful and forbidden; or if any take offence at worſhipping God in Kirks builded in the times of Popery, for <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Cuthbert;</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that is is not neceſſary to worſhip God in theſe Kirks, becauſe men may worſhip God in the open fields, or in other houſes, which were not builded for any Saint; though every man who worſhips God in theſe Kirks builded in the times of Popery, to the honour of ſome Saint, cannot prove the neceſſity of worſhipping in this or that individual Kirk; yet the offence is not given, but taken; as Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> ſhews in that diſpute of Scandal, formerly cited Queſt. 6. in the 61. and following pages; and ſhews, <hi>That it's neceſſary for thoſe who take offence at worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in ſuch Kirks, to prove by Scripture-warrant, that it is neceſſary to diſuſe theſe Kirks. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>That the neceſſity of diſuſing the Creature in a Phyſical uſage in the worſhip of God, muſt have a warrant in the Scripture;</hi> and ſo he ſhews, <hi>That the offence that ſome take at Bells, for convening the people to the worſhip of God, is a meer paſſive Scandal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I ſuppoſe, it cannot be denied, that the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:40126:125"/> protection of lawful Authority, is more neceſſary for the conventions of the Lords People for his worſhip, than theſe Houſes or Bells.</p>
               <p>The Author lays the ſtreſs of the Scandal which he alledges was given by accepting of the Indulgence, upon this ground, <hi>That this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance as circumſtantial, was not expedient and neceſſary;</hi> and he ſuppoſes, that it will be eaſily granted, <hi>That the acceptance of the Indulgence was not a thing in its ſelf neceſſary, ſo as it could not be refuſed without manifeſt ſin againſt the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is ordinary, I perceive, with this Author in this Hiſtory, to take for granted that which he ſhould prove; as for that which he adds, <hi>That if there be not a manifeſt ſin in refuſing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, then the taking of offence at the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of it, will prove that there was offence given in the acceptance;</hi> will not be ſo eaſily granted as he ſuppoſes: For ſuppoſe that one could not make it manifeſt and evident, that there were ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord in demoliſhing or diſuſing St. <hi>Giles</hi> or St. <hi>Cuthberts</hi> Kirk, or in breaking or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſing the Bells which had been abuſed in the time of Popery; it were very hard to condemn that man, who together with the reſt of the Lords people convened for the worſhip of God at St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s Kirk, upon the ringing of Bells, which had been abuſed in the times of Popery; I ſay it were hard to condemn him of the ſin of giving Scandal, in his going to theſe Kirks upon the ringing of theſe Bells.</p>
               <p>As for the expediency and neceſſity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of the relaxation of the rigour of the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:40126:125"/> penal ſtatutes, as before explained; or which is all one, accepting of the peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry under the protection of lawful Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the indulged Miniſters have much to ſay for the expediency and neceſſity of this acceptance, and for their not refuſing this relaxation and protection when offered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some things are neceſſary by Divine Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, as Magiſtracy; <hi>Whoſoever reſiſts the power,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>reſiſts the Ordinance of God; and the Powers that be, are ordained of God,</hi> Rom. 13.1, 2. &amp;c. And as Magiſtracy, ſo Miniſtry is the Ordinance of God, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>And God hath ſet ſome in the Church, firſt Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some things are neceſſary by Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; as for example, the exerciſe of the power of the Magiſtrate is not only neceſſary by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Gods inſtituting and ordaining Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but alſo by the command of God, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges Magiſtrates to puniſh vice, to execute wrath upon them who do evil, to promove, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and praiſe that which is good; to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect their Subjects in well-doing, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve peace. And ſo Miniſters are under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of preaching the Goſpel by the command of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some things are neceſſary, becauſe God hath made them uſeful and convenient for man, and hath given them to man for his uſe; they are in their nature convenient for man, given and deſigned of God for the good of man; thus meat and cloathing, and houſes, peace, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:40126:126"/> of lawful Authority, are neceſſary.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some things are neceſſary means in order to a neceſſary end; and theſe again are neceſſary, either ſimply for attaining the end, or neceſſary for the better or more eaſie and convenient at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the end; as a houſe is neceſſary, not ſimply for hearing of the word, but for the more convenient hearing of the word, becauſe it ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the Miniſter and people from ſtorms, winds, and ſcorching heat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus the protection of lawful Authority is neceſſary for the peaceable hearing of the word without diſturbance.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Some things are neceſſary for preventing of evil; the evil either of ſin, or of affliction and calamity.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Some things become neceſſary, or the more neceſſary to be done, becauſe of thoſe who urge the forbearance of them out of ſome erroneous principle, or for eſtabliſhing of ſome error. And thus Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> ſheweth in the forecited Treatiſe, <hi>That to forbear the cating of Swines-fleſh before a Jew, who alledges that it is a ſin, or breach of the Commandment of God to do ſo; to forbear it now when we are fully poſſeſſed in that liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free, were to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the Jew in his Judaiſm; and the way to bring us again under the yoke of the Ceremonial Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now 1. ſeeing God hath ordained Magiſtracy for protection of his ſervants and people, and for protecting them in the exerciſe of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, it was expedient and neceſſary to accept of this Protection when offered, and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it; for the acceptance of the effect and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:40126:126"/> of the exerciſe of that Authority which is Gods Ordinance, was an acknowledgment and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ordinance of God; a honouring of thoſe to whom by Divine appointment honour is due. And this was a contributing to render the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God effectual for that end for which he had inſtituted and ordained it; and upon the contrary, the refuſing of this relaxation, and of the protection of lawful Authority, would have been a ſlighting and deſpiſing of the Ordinance of God, and a doing of that which tended to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Ordinance of God ineffectual for that end and uſe for which God ordained it. Now the relaxation of this reſtraint which had been long upon the publick exerciſe of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and the protection of lawful Authority, which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> accepted of, was the very exerciſe of that Authority which is the Ordinance of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Seeing the Magiſtrate in looſing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint which hindred the peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry, did his duty, he did ſomewhat of that which he was obliged to do; it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that the Miniſters whom they were willing to looſe from the reſtraint formerly laid on, and whom they were willing to protect in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exciſe of their Miniſtry, ſhould in their place and ſtation further and promove the Magiſtrate in any good which he was willing to do; as when a Miniſter is willing to do his duty in preaching and Catechiſing, the people ſhould be willing to hear and be Catechiſed; ſo when a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is willing to permit or allow Miniſters to preach in his Dominions, and to protect them
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:40126:127"/> in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry, it's the duty of Miniſters who have the acceſs to the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry under the protection of lawful Authority, to accept of the peaceable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their Miniſtry; and to refuſe this offer, were the way to mar and ſtifle the good which the Magiſtrate was willing to do. Now when the Magiſtrate is willing to do any thing which is right and his duty, it's a ſin to mar, impede, and ſtifle any good that he is willing to do.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Seeing peace and the protection of lawful Authority, and the peaceable exerciſe of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry under the protection of lawful Authority, are great bleſſings of God, and God promiſes and gives them to his people as great benefits, and his people are obliged to pray for them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.18. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.15, 16, 17, 18. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.6, 7, 8, 9. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2. Therefore it's neceſſary to accept theſe mercies and benefits when the Lord in his Providence offers and gives them; and to refuſe them when they are offered, were to ſlight the mercies of God, and to refuſe what we are bound to ſeek, and to be thankful for, when we get it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Seeing the fixed, ſetled, and peaceable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the Miniſtry, is ſo neceſſary, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the Lords taking care that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters might be ſetled in Cities and Churches; and from the many conveniencies of a ſetled Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, which are wanting in an unfixed Miniſtry; for they who may not ſtay among a people, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo know their ſtate and caſe, and ſo cannot apply their Doctrine ſutable to their caſe; and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:40126:127"/> cannot make full proof of their Miniſtry among them, in laying the foundation in all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the doctrine of God; and then leading the people forward unto greater perfection in knowledge in declaring the whole Counſel of God; and they have not acceſs to Catechiſe, and viſit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as thoſe who have the ſetled and fixed exerciſe of their Miniſtry have; and then peace and quietneſs in preaching and hearing the Goſpel, hath many conveniences; people not only know whither they ſhall go to hear, but they may come ſeaſonably without hazard by the way, and without fear of diſturbance when they are come; ſo that they may more compoſe themſelves for hearing, than they can who are in a continual apprehenſion of a hoſtile Invaſion, and often alarmed with hearing or ſeeing ſome noiſe or appearance of armed ſoldiers. Theſe fears and confuſions are great Impediments of the ſanctification of the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Now the ſetled and peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry, which is ſo many ways expedient and neceſſary, cannot be had but by the Magiſtrate; and therefore to have refuſed to make any uſe of the Indulgence, had been to refuſe the ſetled and peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This acceptance was uſeful for preventing many evils of ſin and calamity. The indulged Miniſters could not ſee how they could without ſin refuſe to make any uſe of the Indulgence; and they conceived their refuſal to take the benefit of the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry, would have given occaſion of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:40126:128" rendition="simple:additions"/> and provocation to the Magiſtrate, and to the deſtitute Congregations who deſired their help; the deſire of a people who are wandring as ſheep without a Shepherd, had a cry that they could not ſee how they could ſlight without ſin. The acceptance prevented the filling of the Kirk with a Conformiſt, whom the people would not have heard; and freed thoſe Pariſhes of the quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, plunderings, impriſonments, which they were formerly obnoxious unto; it prevented their uncertain wandrings on the Sabbath, their diſquieting and confounding fears, their running and fleeing on the Sabbath, which is ſuch a cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, that our Saviour directs the Jews to pray that their flight might not be in the winter, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the Sabbath-day, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented rendevouſing, and fighting, and ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling blood with Sacrifices on the Lords day. The many diſorders and confuſions, and ſad ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, the impriſonments and finings, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, and the great effuſion of the blood of the people of God, which have followed upon the hoſtile claſhings betwixt Magiſtrates and people, may teach us how neceſſary the peaceable exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the Miniſtry under lawful Authority is, and how neceſſary it is to take, and ſeek, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after peace with all men; eſpecially with the Magiſtrate</p>
               <p>The Indulged Miniſters cannot, nor could not ſee how a refuſing to have any making or medling with the Magiſtrate, which theſe Authors urge, could conſiſt with the reſpect due to Authority, or with that command, <hi>follow peace with all men;
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:40126:128"/> and if it be poſſible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The refuſing to make any uſe of the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence upon the grounds that theſe Authors go upon, would make the refuſing ſcandalous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe refuſing upon their grounds, would eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh ſeveral ſcandalous errors; as for example, the Author of the <hi>Cup of cold Water,</hi> and of the Epiſtle prefixed to this Hiſtory of the Indulgence, alledges, <hi>That no uſe ſhould have been made of the Indulgence, becauſe no Propoſals made by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, ſhould be liſtned to; no Propoſals ſhould be made to them, nothing ſhould be ſought or taken from them; that there ſhould be no making or med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with them;</hi> and further he aſſerts, <hi>That this courſe is that which God calleth us to; and that this is the way wherein alone we can expect Gods approbation.</hi> And he builds theſe errors upon falſe grounds, which we have before refuted; and the principal ground upon which he builds theſe wild conceits, is, becauſe the Magiſtrate hath aſſumed an unlawful Supremacy, which eſtabliſhes this error in the minds of thoſe that believe him, That when the Magiſtrate aſſumes any ſuch Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, it makes void that Authority which he hath from God.</p>
               <p>The Author of the Hiſtory goeth upon the ſame ground, and alledges no liberty, though free of all entanglements and grounds of ſcrupling, ſhould be made uſe of, ſeeing Adverſaries are not really repenting; and that any ſuch permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion could not be ſuppoſed to flow from right principles and right deſigns, which fixes that
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:40126:129"/> error in the minds of thoſe who will believe him, That except the Magiſtrate be really peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and act from right principles and deſigns, no uſe can be made of any permiſſion to preach the Goſpel granted by him. Theſe are errors ſcandalous and of dangerous conſequence; he alſo goes upon this ground, That the indulgence ſhould be refuſed, becauſe the Magiſtrate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points or permits to preach in a certain place. Now we ſaw from the firſt Book of Diſcipline, that the Magiſtrate may in ſome caſes appoint Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to preach in ſome places; and in the ſecond Book of Diſcipline, That the Magiſtrate may in ſome caſes place Miniſters; and if a Magiſtrate might in no caſe appoint a Miniſter to preach in a certain place, but only might appoint him to preach; then a Miniſter, if he were ill-diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, might elude the deſign of a godly Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; for he might preach where there were no need of his preaching, and not there where the Magiſtrate findeth greateſt need; or he might preach where there were few or none to hear him; and ſo render the appointment and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Magiſtrate, who intended the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his Subjects, of no effect. His conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that no uſe could be made of the Indulgence, becauſe the Magiſtrates wrote Inſtructions for the indulged Miniſters, does eſtabliſh that error, That the Magiſtrate by writing Inſtructions for Miniſters, may bind up the Miniſters Conſcience that he cannot preach any where, where the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate permits him to preach, and writes In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions for him. To have refuſed to make
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:40126:129"/> any uſe of the Indulgence upon theſe grounds, had been to give a great number of dangerous offences, and to fix theſe errors which are of dangerous conſequence. But the acceptance of the Relaxation, and of the Protection of lawful Authority, did not give offence, but was for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification.</p>
               <p>If he object, as he doth elſewhere, <hi>That there was no abſolute neceſſity of their peaceable preaching, for they might have preached with hazard as others did in the mountains; and therefore there was no abſolute neceſſity of their acceptance of the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; and therefore in accepting it, they gave ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer: That it will not follow, that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance did give ſcandal, becauſe there was no abſolute neceſſity of acceptance; for there is no abſolute neceſſity of making uſe of the Churches builded in the times of Popery to ſuch or ſuch Saints; nor is there an abſolute neceſſity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of Bells to convene the people, becauſe the people may meet elſewhere than in theſe Churches; and they may be convened, though not ſo conveniently without Bells. And yet Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> ſheweth, <hi>That there is no offence given <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

               </p>
               <p>Again I retort: Preaching in the Mountains i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> not abſolutely and ſimply neceſſary; for if that were true, all people, though all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, behoved to forſake the Kirks, and go to the fields; and there ought to be no
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:40126:130"/> preaching in any place of the World, but in fields and Mountains. But I ſuppoſe he would have been far from ſaying that the preaching in the Mountains did give offence to thoſe who took offence at it; ſo that a leſs neceſſity than that which is ſimple and abſolute, is ſufficient to prevent an active ſcandal.</p>
               <p>Again, though there be not an abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of peaceable preaching, becauſe the Goſpel hath been and may be preached where the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is Pagan and doth not permit it; yet the peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry is very deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and as we heard before, the fixed peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry is very neceſſary, in order to many good uſes, and to prevent many ills; and therefore when the Lord inclines the heart of Rulers to grant it, it is neceſſary not to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it.</p>
               <p>The diſputes of our Predeceſſors againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Popiſh Ceremonies, does no way quadrate with his diſputes againſt the acceptance of the peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry under the protection of lawful Authority; for our Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors proved, That theſe Ceremonies were the meer Inventions and Devices of men, will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, contrary to the ſecond Commandment, and that they were nocent and hurtful; but he hath not proven by his foregoing Arguments, That the aforeſaid acceptance was ſinful; he ſays in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>That he hath ſufficiently done it,</hi> but we have ſeen the inſufficiency of his proofs.</p>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:40126:130"/>
               <p>Again, they who pleaded for theſe Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, granted that they were indifferent, and the Nonconformiſts argued againſt them upon this ſuppoſition; but the peaceable exerciſe of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and the protection of lawful Authority, are not the Inventions of men, but Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, and not indifferent; but many ways expedient and neceſſary.</p>
               <p>He ſays alſo, <hi>That there was a manifeſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of evil in this acceptance;</hi> but he doth not prove it. That place 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.17. is rendred by ſome thus, <hi>Abſtain from all kind of evil.</hi> If it be rendred appearance, the ill appearance muſt be in the object, and not in the diſtempered eye and conceit. Some folk apprehend appearances of evil in things which have no appearance of evil in themſelves, but all the appearance is in their own phanſie and conceit. Mr. <hi>Durham</hi> in his Treatiſe of Scandal, pag. 6, 7. gives, for example, of this appearance of evil, dangerous and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful expreſſions of Doctrine that have been or uſe to be abuſed, and practices which are not becoming that honeſty and good report which a Chriſtian ought to ſtudy.</p>
               <p>The Author hath not made it manifeſt, That this acceptance was any kind of evil, or ſuch an appearance of evil. It's ſuperfluous to run through the reſt of this head, becauſe he doth not prove that the acceptance gave offence to any perſons, only he reckons up ſeveral perſons to whom he alledges it gave offence; and if accuſations make guilty, the Author hath made the indulged Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters very guilty; but it's but a guilt of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:40126:131"/> I ſhall only clear, That the eating of not eating of the meats the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in the place cited by the Author, was every way indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent at that time, and ſo cannot be a parallel of the acceptance of the peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry, and the Protection of lawful Authority, which are not things meerly indifferent. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency of eating or not eating of ſuch or ſuch meats at that time, is excellently cleared by Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> in his forecited Treatiſe of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal; becauſe the Book is not common, I ſhall tranſcribe one Objection and Anſwer, in which as in many other parts of that Treatiſe, there are ſeveral things appoſite to the preſent debate of Scandal. <q>Pag. 67. And before I come to the ſecond Concluſion, an Houſe for the worſhip of God, are among the things which are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, by way of disjunction. <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> not <hi>in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuo;</hi> that is, a houſe is neceſſary in its Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical uſe, to fence off our bodies the injuries of Sun, Air, and heat; but not this houſe; for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother houſe may ſerve the turn as conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But ſome object, Then this or that houſe dedicated ſuperſtitiouſly to the religious Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Saint, ought to be removed out of the worſhip of God. 1. Becauſe by your own Confeſſion, this individual houſe ſo abuſed, is not neceſſary. God may well be worſhipped without this houſe, though it had never been <hi>in rerum natura.</hi> 2. From the worſhipping of God in ſo ſuperſtitious a place, many truly godly are ſo ſcandalized, that for worſhipping
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:40126:131"/> God in ſuch ſuperſtitious and idolatrous places, they have ſeparated from your Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that in ſo doing, you heal the wounds of the Beaſt. It's true, it may be their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yea, but be it ſo, that it were their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, that they are ſcandalized; yet by your Doctrine in things not neceſſary, you are not to do any thing by which either the weak or the wicked may be ſcandalized, as is clear in the eating of Meats, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.</q>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Argument may (1.) be retorted againſt thoſe who hold with us in the ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Scandal; for without eating of Swines-fleſh my life may be preſerved; and a malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Jew may be, and is neceſſarily highly ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized that I, who poſſibly am a Jew convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Chriſtian Faith, do eat Swines-fleſh before him; for he conceiveth me to be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate from <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law; therefore I ſhould abſtain from eating Swines-fleſh before a Jew, who out of malice is ſcandalized by my doing a thing not neceſſary <hi>hic &amp; nunc;</hi> but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is abſurd; nor do I think, That many truly godly of the ſtricteſt Separation, do ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at our Churches out of wickedneſs; many truly godly and ſincere refuſe to come to our Churches; whereas many ſcandalous, well-lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered Hypocrites, who know nothing of the power of Godlineſs, but are ſitten down in the Scorners chair, are admitted to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and as the former cannot be excuſed, ſo I pray God that the latter draw not down the wrath of God upon both Kingdoms.
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:40126:132"/> (2.) Things not neceſſary, which actively pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Scandal, muſt not only be indifferent Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally in their natural uſe, as this or that Houſe, but they muſt be indifferent both Phyſically and Morally; for the meats ſpoken of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. at that time were both ways indifferent. 1.

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:40126:132"/> and Air, though this Houſe had never been <hi>in rerum natura:</hi> But this Temple or Houſe, though dedicated to a Saint, is not morally indifferent, but morally neceſſary; ſo as if you remove it from the Worſhip, becauſe abuſed to Idolatry, and give it no uſe in the defending of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies from the injuries of the Wind, Rain, and Sun, you Judaize, and do actively ſcandalize the Jews, and harden them in their Apoſtacy; and ſo this Houſe, though abuſed to Idolatry, is not indifferent morally, as the meats, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. But the uſing of it is neceſſary, and an aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of our Chriſtian liberty, as to eat blood and things ſtrangled even before a Jew. So to uſe all houſes for a Phyſical end to defend our bodies from Heat and Cold, is a part of the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free; but Ceremonies have no natural nor Phyſical uſe; the croſſing of the Air with the Thumb, the keeping of a day religiouſly without war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the word, are not taught in the School of Nature, and ſo are naturally not neceſſary, as this or that Houſe though abuſed to Superſtition is; and the Adverſaries that ſay they are morally indifferent, as good and as ſpiritual Ceremonies in kind and nature, may be deviſed in their place. But in all this diſpute of Scandal, we give, but we never grant that the Ceremonies are indifferent; we diſpute here, That they are ſcandalous, and ſo unlawful in their uſe, upon the Principles of Formaliſts; whereas we judge them in their Nature, becauſe they have not God, but the will of men to be their Father and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:40126:133"/> Author to be unlawful and repugnant to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe not warranted by either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, practiſe, or promiſe in Scripture.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So far Mr. <hi>Rutherford:</hi> from which we may ſee, that the uſing of a Houſe, though it hath been idolatrouſly abuſed, for this end to defend our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies from heat and cold, is a part of the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free. Now any who will not ſhut their eyes, may ſee that the ſeeking and taking the Protection of lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, is more neceſſary than the making uſe of this or that individual Houſe. We cannot have the benefit of publick houſes for worſhip, without the Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, The Protection of the Magiſtrate defends from injuries that are much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious and hurtful, than the injuries of Wind and Rain, and ſcorching by the Sun; a houſe can but defend from ſhowers of Rain, Hail, ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Heat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the Protection of lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority defends from ſhowers of Bullets, and the ſcorching-Heat of Perſecution.</p>
               <p>Again, men might be ſheltred by another houſe, though St. <hi>Cuthberts,</hi> or St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s Kirk, were caſt down; but the peaceable exerciſe of the preaching and hearing of the word in publick, cannot be had without the Protection of Civil Authority.</p>
               <p>Now if the Scandal taken at taking the ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of St. <hi>Cuthberts</hi> Kirk in hearing the word, ſhould not make folk diſuſe that Kirk, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive themſelveS of the uſe of it; much leſs ſhould the taking offence at the taking of the Protection of lawful Authority for the publick peaceable
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:40126:133"/> exerciſe of the Miniſtry, make Miniſters and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple deprive themſelves of the Protection of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, whom the Lord calls the Shields of the earth; ſeeing the Magiſtrates permitting and allowing Miniſters to preach, and protecting them in preaching, is the very exerciſe of that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which they have from God for good.</p>
               <p>And further, from Mr. <hi>Rutherfords</hi> words we may ſee, That the eating or not eating, in the places cited by the Author, does no way qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate with the caſe of acceptance or no accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; for as Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> ſhews, That at that time the eating or not eating, was both Phyſical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Morally indifferent.</p>
               <p>The Author hath not proven the acceptance or no acceptance to be indifferent; and any who will take up this Club and Quarrel, will find it a hard task to prove the acceptance or no accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance Phyſically and Morally indifferent; and ſo the caſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. do no way quadrate with this. The eating of fleſh forbidden in the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law, was no ways neceſſary at that time, when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans;</hi> and his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> it was neither Phyſically nor Morally neceſſary at that time, to eat thoſe fleſhes before a weak Jew; for they who knew their Chriſtian liberty, might eat thoſe fleſhes in private, and when ſuch weak Brethren were not preſent. But the acceptance of the relaxation of the Civil reſtraint formerly laid on by the Magiſtrate, the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Protection of lawful Authority, was ſeveral ways neceſſary, as we ſaw before. The
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:40126:134"/> peaceable, fixed, ſetled preaching and hearing of the Goſpel, is a very deſirable end; and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of the Protection of Civil Authority is neceſſary in order to this end; for as the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Author of the late Apology, printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1677. acknowledgeth the peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry, is from the Magiſtrate; pag. 111. where he grants, <hi>That it is within the compaſs of the Magiſtrates power to give liberty to Miniſters and people for ſerving and worſhipping of God in his Son Jeſus Chriſt. This,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we do not deny, but chearfully grant, That although the exerciſe of Church-power, that is properly ſuch, be independent on the Magiſtrate, yet the peaceable exerciſe of it is truly from him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pag. 113. Sect. 1. He ſays, <hi>That the accepters of the Indulgence did hereby give offence to ſuch of their Brethren as had the offer, but were no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> cleared, nor convinced of the lawfulneſs of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of ſuch a favour at ſuch a time.</hi> Now how proves he this, That they gave offence? <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>by their example theſe were encouraged and moved to do that which they judged ſinful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful for them to do.</hi> I wonder how a reaſonable man, who had read any thing concerning the nature of Scandal, could give ſuch a reaſon; for according to this reaſon, whoſoever does that which another judges unlawful for him to do, he by his doing gives offence; this is a moſt falſe and abſurd Propoſition. Our Saviour did ſeveral things which the Jews judged ſinful and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them to do; but it were blaſphemous to infer that therefore our Saviour in doing theſe
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:40126:134"/> things, gave offence to the Jews. This Doctrine of the Author, teaches people that will believe him, to judge, that whatſoever they judge unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them to do, that that is in it ſelf ſinful and unlawful; for whatſoever gives offence, is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; for every thing that gives offence, is ſome way or other inordinate; and this makes the judgment, it may be, but of one man who judges ſomething ſinful and unlawful for him to do, to bind up others that they cannot do that which he thinks ſinful; for if they ſhould do it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Author, they ſhould give offence and ſo ſin; this would make the Judgment of one er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring man, who thinks that ſinful which is not, ſo to be a Law to others, which were an intolerable yoke of bondage.</p>
               <p>The Reverend Brethren who had not clearneſs to make uſe of the Indulgence, were far from this erroneous conceit to think, That becauſe they had not clearneſs to accept of the Indulgence, that therefore they who accepted of it, did ſin and give offence.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures which he cites, as we did ſhew before out of Mr. <hi>Rutherfords</hi> Diſpute of Scandal, are impertinently cited; becauſe the eating or not eating of theſe meats at that time, was every way indifferent, Phyſically and Morally indifferent, and no way neceſſary; but the acceptance was in ſeveral reſpects neceſſary, as was ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; eſpecially becauſe they could not have the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry without the Magiſtrate; but the eating of theſe meats the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, might be forborn without
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:40126:135"/> any prejudice to him who was perſwaded of his Chriſtian liberty; he might forbear it without any prejudice or hurt to his body; for he might get other meat to eat, when theſe weak Brethren who took offence at eating, were preſent: If there had been no other meat, and he would have been in hazard of his life if he did not eat; and if he could not have gotten ſhifted out of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of theſe weak Brethren, then the caſe would have been altered, and not eating in that caſe had been a breach of the ſixth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi> In ſuch a neceſſity it was lawful for <hi>David</hi> to eat the Shew-bread, and ſo his eating would have been neceſſary, and the offence would have been taken by the weak Brethren, but not given by the eater; but if he found theſe meats uſeful for his body, and could get the preſence of the weak ſhifted, he might eat them in private, as Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> ſheweth in the foreſaid Diſpute.</p>
               <p>Again, he might forbear eating without any prejudice to his ſoul; becauſe, as Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> ſheweth, at that time the eating was morally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different; there was no ſin at that time in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing to eat thoſe meats before a weak Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But now when we are fully poſſeſt of our Chriſtian liberty, it were a ſin to forbear eating ſuch meats before a Jew, becauſe of his taking of offence at eating; for that were an hardning of him in his Judaiſm.</p>
               <p>Pag. 113. Sect. 2. he ſays, <hi>They gave offence to others who had not this Indulgence in their offer, yet judged the accepting thereof unlawful upon the ground laſt mentioned.</hi>

               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:40126:135"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> What ground means he? if he means that ground which he lays down in the laſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction near the beginning, becauſe they judged it ſinful and unlawful for themſelves to have done it: We have ſhewed the groundleſneſs and falſhood, and dangerous conſequence of this ground; or if he mean, That the acceptance was as indifferent, and every way as unneceſſary as the eating in the caſe that the Apoſtles words late to, he is much miſtaken, as appears from what is ſaid before. He ſays in the end of this ſecond Section, <hi>That they ſhould have refuſed the Indulgence, ſeeing there wanted not who told them of the evil they conceived to lye therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But 1. as I ſhewed before, this reaſon is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levant; for it makes the judgment of one man to be an obliging Rule to another.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Indulged Miniſters did ſee and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the evils which were in the complex Acts of the Magiſtrate, which related to the Indulgence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Reverend Brethren who had not clearneſs to make uſe of the Indulgence, did not tell the indulged Miniſters, That there was evil in accepting of the relaxation of the reſtraint; or that there was evil in acceping of the peaceabl exerciſe of their Miniſtry, or of the Protection of lawful Authority in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry; ſo that theſe Reverend Brethren did not ſay, That there was evil in what the Indulged accepted, for theſe were the things which the indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters accepted, as we cleared from Mr. <hi>H's</hi> ſpeech before the Council; but on the contrary, they declare, That there is good in this, as appears
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:40126:136" rendition="simple:additions"/> from Mr. <hi>Burnets</hi> Paper, ſet down in this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, pag. 46. Sect. 5. As for the permiſſion and allowance I have to preach when confined, this permiſſion ſeemeth very far, when I look on it abſtractly without relation to the reſt of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Circumſtances of the Act; for this would look like the opening of the door in part which the Magiſtrate himſelf had ſhut; and afterward he ſays, <hi>For permiſſion to preach in any vacant Church within the Kingdom, is ſo very great a favour, as for which I would deſire to bleſs God, and thank his Majeſty moſt heartily.</hi> And in his Letter to my L. Chancellor, pag. 48. he ſhews himſelf clear for Miniſters going not only to their former Charges, but to other Congregations as they ſhall have opportunity of a cordial Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the people.</p>
               <p>And in the other Paper drawn up by the ten Miniſters, ſet down pag. 48, 49, 50, 51. of this Hiſtory, in the 51. page their third deſire to the Council is, <hi>That your L. L. would be pleaſed to deal with his Majeſty to take off the legal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints on our Miniſtry and Perſons, that we may peaceably give our ſelves to the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry for the edification of the body of Chriſt.</hi> And we heard from pag. 111. of the late Apology, That the peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry is from the Magiſtrate; ſo that theſe Reverend Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters were ſo far from accounting that evil, which the indulged Miniſters accepted, that they accounted it deſirable, and did deſire it; and by this it may appear how far theſe Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Miniſters were from the Sentiments of this
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:40126:136" rendition="simple:additions"/> Author of the Hiſtory, and the Author of the <hi>Cup of cold Water,</hi> and of the Letter prefixed to the Hiſtory of the Indulgence.</p>
               <p>The difference betwixt thoſe Reverend Brethren who did not accept, and theſe who did accept, was not in their Principles anent the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church; nor did they differ anent the ills which are in the complex Acts of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, which both by word and writings drawn up by the conſent of Indulged and not Indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Miniſters, is manifeſt; but the difference was in this, That the indulged Miniſters conceived that it was their duty to take what was good in the Indulgence, and refuſe what was evil.</p>
               <p>The Reverend Brethren who had no clearneſs to aceept, conceived that in taking the good, they would be ſome way involved in an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretative approbation of the evil; and this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of apprehenſion, as it was no ground of diviſion, ſo it made no diviſion betwixt the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſters and their Brethren who were not indulged; only about the time of the ſecond In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, one or two at moſt of Miniſters that were ordained before the Revolution, began to drop firſt more privately, and then more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, ſome ſeeds of Schiſm among the people who before were profiting under the Miniſtry of the indulged Miniſters; and then ſome young men, whoſe Judgments had not been formed at Colledges of Divinity under Orthodox Doctors of Divinity (which is an unſpeakable loſs to many well inclined youths) and who were not ſtudied <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:40126:137" rendition="simple:additions"/> of Noncofnormiſts againſt Schiſm, through a raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs very incident to young men who want experience, did further diſtemper the poor people; and perceiving that ſome people were very fond upon thoſe Preachers who ſpoke moſt againſt the Indulgence, and cryed them moſt up; this was a great ſnare to theſe youths, and a great grief to the grave judicious Miniſters, who were not indulged.</p>
               <p>It was not the Councils deſign, as ſome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but this ſtickling in preaching things which tended to diviſion, which divided the people. It is not deſigns of Magiſtrates to divide which doth really divide; nay any that have ſenſe, if they perceive that Magiſtrates have a mind to divide them, they will ſo much the more ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy unity; but if the Contrivers of the Indulgence had a deſign of dividing, it was thoſe who vented diviſive Doctrines in publick and private who did effectuate that deſign, which would never have been effectual without this. I ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn the words of the reverend Author of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology, publiſhed <hi>An.</hi> 1677. who is commended by the Author of this Hiſtory. I wiſh the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Hiſtory had learned of him to ſeek for peace, and to render deſigns of diviſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual; the Author of the Hiſtory widens the wound which the Author of the Apology en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to heal, as appears by what he writes, pag. 128, and 129. of that Apology. I ſhall tranſcribe his words, becauſe they confirm what hath been ſaid, That there is no difference in the profeſſed Principles about the Government
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:40126:137"/> of the Church, or about the ills which are in the complex of the Indulgence, betwixt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged and not Indulged Miniſters: his words pag. 128. are theſe. <hi>For whatever difference there hath been, or yet is amongſt us in our practice, in relation to the Indulgence; we are all agreed in the preceding exceptions againſt it; and if there had been acceſs for preſenting the ſame to our Rulers, our Unanimity and Concord in theſe, had been more diſcovered and made known to the World than it is; there is no change with us about our known and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Judgment about the Government of the Church in its true diſtinction from, and in dependance on the Magiſtrate, as is afterward expreſſed; whatever was our perſwaſion of this, repreſented to the World in our publick Confeſſion of Faith, we yet through the Grace of God, reſolve to cleave to, having never ſeen or heard of any thing in all the times that have gone over our heads, to cauſe us to alter our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of this matter in the leaſt. Some (who take hold of all occaſions to reproach us) are pleaſed to repreſent ſome, their acceptance of this Indulgence as contradictory to, and inconſiſtent with our former profeſſed Principles anent Church-Government; yet any who conſider what was ſhortly hinted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:40126:138" rendition="simple:additions"/> but rather an endeavour to contract and ineffectuate them, that our oppoſites may have no benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, to the prejudice of the Miniſters of Chriſt, for which we contend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus far that Reverend Author of the Apology; where we ſee that the Indulged and Non-indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged are ſtill united in Judgment about the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church, and in diſapproving the ills which are in the complex Acts of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence; and that this Author is not pleaſed with thoſe who are pleaſed to repreſent this acceptance as contradictory to, and inconſiſtent with our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer profeſſed Principles; and acknowledges that what theſe indulged Miniſters ſpoke before the Council, and at their entry to theſe Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is ſufficient to convince their adherence to their former Principles. And he ſhews, that the difference is only in practice; and this difference would have been leſs, if ſome few who were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ill making uſe of the indulgence, had not obſtructed a written Teſtimony againſt the ills in the complex of the Indulgence; for if that had been agreed on, more would have had clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to have made uſe of the Indulgence; and then this difference of practice would have been leſs, if the caſe of others had been the ſame with the caſe of theſe who accepted; but this made a notable diſparity in the caſe, that ſeveral who refuſed to make uſe of the Indulgence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed upon this account, becauſe they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined and permitted to preach in Pariſhes which were already provided with Miniſters; ſo that they thought their preaching there was ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:40126:138"/> and they might do more good elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
               <p>As to the Authors Sect. 3. we have ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, That this acceptance was no Homologa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any ſinful Supremacy; and they who look on it ſo, the fault is in their own eye; the impertinency of the Scripture cited, we clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, out of Mr. <hi>Rutherfords</hi> diſpute of Scandal.</p>
               <p>As for his 4th. pag. 114. we ſhewed before, That the Indulged Miniſters did not contrary to their engagements leave their Brethren. The Miniſters who went to <hi>Holland</hi> would think they were injured, if any ſhould alledge, That they had left their Brethren, becauſe they took the benefits of the peaceable exerciſe of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry under the protection of the Magiſtrates in <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for his 5th. it's falſe, That the hands of thoſe who were not indulged, were weakened, the number of the bearers of burthens waxing ſmaller; for the indulged did ſtill continue to be bearers of burdens; and the favour ſhewed to them, encouraged other Miniſters to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to preach more and more publickly than they had done before; and there was this further advantage, That many people heard the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſters, who would not have ventured to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ear other Miniſters preach; ſo that the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence was to the furtherance of the Goſpel. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ndulged Miniſters did not ſtep off, but ſtepped <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o their work in the Congregations to which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent; and it was no prepoſterous tenderneſs to
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:40126:139"/> forbear preaching in thoſe places which were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with Preachers, where there was ſo many places where no Presbyterian Miniſters were ſetled.</p>
               <p>To his 6th. I have anſwered before, That the practice of the Indulged Miniſters, did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Prelates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in any defection.</p>
               <p>To his 7th. They gave no offence to Rulers, but edified them; they did and ſaid what tended to their edification; if they had (as the Authors would) refuſed to make or meddle with them at all, they would have offended by provoking them to wrath, in refuſing what was good; but they took what was good, and by word and deed did ſhew, That they diſapproved of what was ill in the complex of the Indulgence.</p>
               <p>As for the 8th. If the practice of the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſters be rightly repreſented to poſterity, it will edifie and not ſtumble. His 8th is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon that falſe foundation, that the indulged Miniſters have complied with grievous uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>And his 9th. upon that falſe ground, That the indulged Miniſters have ſubmitted to the exerciſe of Eraſtianiſm. It's they who ſpread ſuch falſe aſperſions of honeſt men, who give offence to Poſterity, and the reformed Churches abroad Let a true Narration of the practice of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Miniſters be given to the Reformed Churches abroad, and the indulged Miniſters doubt not of the approbation of thoſe Churches and they doubt as little, that all the reformed Churches, if they heard the ſtrange Tenets and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:40126:139"/> diviſive practices of their Authors, they would condemn them as erroneous of dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and ſome of them as ſtriking at the very foundation of all order Civil and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical.</p>
               <p>It's ſad, That offences, real offences, do ſo abound, and that ſo many ſtumble at theſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and that many make offences where there is none, and ſtumble where there is no Stumbling-block; and ſome ſtumble at the Lords Ordinances, and ſome ſtumble at others, becauſe they hear the word; and this Author furthered that ſtumbling by a Letter, in which he aſſerted, That there was ſin wrapped up in hearing the indulged Miniſters; and thus poor people are taught to ſtumble at the means of others Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p>Having anſwered his Arguments contained in his Hiſtory, I ſhall take ſome notice of ſome things which he hath in his Letters, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which hath any ſhadow of reaſon in this Authors writings, may ſeem to be neglected. In one of theſe Letters he ſays, <hi>Who, I pray, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe Indulged men, as I ſay, as ſuch (for otherways I honour ſuch as are known to me, and ſhall entertain charitable thoughs of others) can be called the Ambaſſadors of Chriſt, who depend as to the actual exerciſe of their miniſterial Function, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n ſuch immediately who never were intruſted, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ven as to kind, with Church-power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It's hard enough to reconcile this profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Honour and Charity towards the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſters with ſome of his grievous reproaches
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:40126:140"/> which he hath caſt upon them, which have a direct and manifeſt tendency to render them baſe and contemptible, and to caſt them out of the hearts and affections of all who hear and believe them.</p>
               <p>His Queſtion which he brings in with ſuch a Phraſe, <hi>Who, I pray,</hi> is a very idle Queſtion. I ſuppoſe he is the firſt man, into whoſe head this idle imagination, That the indulged, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged, are the Ambaſſadors of Chriſt, did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; did he ever hear, That any indulged, or any for them, thought or ſaid, That they were Ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as indulged? they were Ambaſſadors before they were indulged, and would be Ambaſſadors although the Indulgence were retracted. The Magiſtrates Indulgence ſuppoſed them Ambaſſadors, and did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute them Ambaſſadors; but it may be he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to argue thus: The indulged, as indulged, are not the Ambaſſadors of Chriſt, and therefore they are not the Ambaſſadors of Chriſt; this is a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful quibble! like that, An Ethiopian as he is black, is not a man; and therefore the black Ethiopian is not a man; a Phyſitian as he hath the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates Patent to practice Phyſick, is not a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian; and therefore the Phyſitian who hath the Magiſtrates Patent, is not a Phyſitian. A Miniſter as he is baniſhed, is not an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor for Chriſt; and therefore a baniſhed Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is not an Ambaſſador for Chriſt. The ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents are true, becauſe blackneſs doth not c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nſtitute the Ethiopian a man, nor hath any eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential or neceſſary connexion with his humanity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or doth the Magiſtrates Patent inſtitute a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:40126:140"/> nor doth baniſhment conſtitute a Miniſter; but the conſequences are naught; for the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions to be ſupplied, are manifeſtly falſe; as for example, he who is not a man as he is black, is not a man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And beſide, the Syllogiſm is made up of Negatives, and ſo is no Syllogiſm at all. I ſhall ſubjoyn the words of a Miniſter not indulged, who in a Letter directed to this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian, hath ſolidly refuted his Letters; and in anſwer to this paſſage of his Letters, ſaith, <hi>We grant that indulged Miniſters as indulged, are not Miniſters, being taken reduplicatively by a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick reduplication; and ſo neither baniſhed nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned Miniſters, are Miniſters, as baniſhed or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned; for none will ſay, That the Indulgence is the formality under which they are Ministers, or the form conſtituent of their Miniſtry: We think you wrong them, and your Readers, who would obtrude ſuch an aſſertion. As baniſhed is not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent form of your Miniſtry, neither is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,</hi> adjectum repugnans, <hi>any more than ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment or impriſonment is; that becauſe he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged therefore</hi> hoc ipſo <hi>he is no Miniſter; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is your aſſertion which ye bring as a proof of this, any more true or warrantable,</hi> viz. <hi>That they have all their power of preaching derived from the Magiſtrate; for it is only a Civil Allowance, freeing the exerciſe of their Miniſtry in the places to which they are reſtricted from moleſtation or reſtraint. This Civil allowance takes away the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of penal Laws which were againſt them —this they have from the Magiſtrates here, as you and ſome others have from the Magiſtrate
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:40126:141"/> where you are theſe years bygon for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of your Miniſtry there; but the Miniſtry it ſelf and its exerciſe they have from Jeſus Chriſt: As when the Civil Magiſtrate convocates a Synod, and gives a civil Tollerance and Protection to them in going, coming and ſitting, which they could not have without his Command or Warrant, though they have the intrinſick power of meeting, ſitting and voting from Chriſt, and not from him; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the outward quiet and ſecurity of their ſitting (ſo as none may moleſt them) is from him; even ſo Miniſters as they are indulged, have the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward civil liberty of a quiet and ſecure preaching of the Goſpel, ſo that no inferiour Courts, Officers, or Soldiers, may moleſt them for their preaching.— The ſimplex indulged Miniſters implies two things,</hi> 1. <hi>As Miniſters, they had before that Indulgence, and ſtill have, a power from Chriſt to preach and adminiſtrate the Sacraments.</hi> 2. <hi>As Indulged, they have the quiet and ſafe exerciſe of that power,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Hiſtorian in another of his Letters miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſents the indulged, <hi>as a fainting Party, who have departed from their ſuffering Brethren; and that they ſtrengthen the hands of the Adverſary, and are for the peoples ſinful compliance with this evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I ſuppoſe I have touched upon ſome of theſe things before. I ſhall only ſay, Theſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have laboured, and have not fainted; they have not ſhunned to declare the whole Counſel of God, nor have they withholden what was convenient for the people; they have given the people faithful warning to beware of thoſe evils
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:40126:141"/> of the time, which the people were in hazard; and though they think it not their duty to turn the preaching of the Goſpel of peace into bitter wrathful invectives againſt any, eſpecially abſent perſons (which is a ſmooth preaching to thoſe who are preſent, who uſe not to be humbled, but rather puffed up by ſuch invectives againſt others); and though they dare not bring rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Accuſations againſt, nor revile nor curſe thoſe who are in lawful Authority; nor deſpiſe dignities, nor ſay any thing which tends to put an evil Spirit betwixt Magiſtrates and people; yet they have been far from flattering any Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers or people in their ſins, but have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bring perſons of all ranks to Repentance, as they have had acceſs and occaſion from the word to diſcover the evil and danger of ſins of all ſorts; and they pray for Repentance to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all ranks; as they think it not their duty to deſign to provoke any perſon to wrath, ſo they ſtudy not to pleaſe any in their ſin; but think themſelves obliged to endeavour to pleaſe all unto edification, and to commend themſelves, though not to the humours, yet to the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of all in the ſight of God. They were not, as was ſhewed before, by Covenant bound to be always actually under the ſame ſufferings, that all who entered in Covenant, did fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; the Lord diſtributes ſufferings among his Servants and People as he ſees meet. Chriſt is at liberty when <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was in Priſon. It had been a very reaſonleſs reaſoning, Chriſt is not to be heard becauſe he is not in priſon as

                  <hi>John</hi> is: the reſt of the Apoſtles are not to be heard, becauſe they are free when <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> are in Priſon; the Angel and Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> are to be diſowned, becauſe they are not under the trial that other Churches are under.</p>
               <p>Again, there are divers kinds of ſuffering; the indulged Miniſters have had their ſhare of reproaches, which uſes to go further than the skin; <hi>Reproach,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, hath broken my heart; reviling Speeches are Perſecutions,</hi> Matth. 5.11. Jer. 18.18. they incite one another <hi>to deviſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices againſt</hi> Jeremiah, <hi>and to ſmite him with the Tongue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I remember not of any thing in the Letters which I have miſſed, except his Predictions: for the Hiſtorian is a ſort of a Prophet; he hath a faculty of foretelling things to come. I know not how he hath fallen upon it, or whether it be be ill come, or not; he very confidently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the year 1677. <hi>That if Mr.</hi> John Welſh <hi>had hearkened to the deſire of drawing near to the ſhelter of an houſe for meeting with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple but for one Sabbath (though that might have contributed for taking off all Sentences againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and others, and to an Univerſal Liberty for all outed Miniſters to preach without Moleſtation) that then he would have forefaulted all the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and countenance he had ſingularly enjoyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time.</hi> This was far ſaid. No ſober ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Perſon will think that it could be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in ſuch Circumſtances at leaſt, to preach at a houſe; but though there had been ſomewhat
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:40126:142"/> wrong in it, how comes he to know, that for that failing Mr. <hi>Welſh</hi> would have loſt the Protection and Countenance which he had formerly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? it was preſumptuous boldneſs for him to take upon him to determine ſo peremptorily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the forefaulting of the Protection and Countenance of God, <hi>who hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and does for his names ſake, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when his peoples ſins teſtifie againſt them, and remembers his Covenant and Mercy for his People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another of his Predictions is, <hi>That all indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Spectators will judge as he ſays, and that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity will ſee and ſay as he ſays, whether the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged men will or not.</hi> But I think they are over-credulous who will believe that he had the foreknowledge what way the Judgments of men preſent, and of the Generations to come, would incline and determine.</p>
               <p>There is yet a third Prediction of another Author, which is, <hi>That the Indulgence ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as odious and deteſtable to all the godly in the Land, as ever Prelacy was.</hi> To this Prophecy the Author of the Hiſtory and Letters, makes an Addition, while he ſays in one of his Letters, <hi>That what that perſon was perſwaded of, will quickly appear;</hi> the firſt had only ſaid it would be; but he ſays it will quickly appear, <hi>augur augurem;</hi> but theſe Prophets were ſo fearfully miſtaken in ſeeing things that were, that there is very good reaſon to doubt of their foreſight of things to come; yet there is more Art in this inartificial Argument founded upon the Authority of a man who hath but confidence to ſay boldly what he
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:40126:143"/> ſays concerning things to come, than in many artificial Arguments; and theſe Predictions will go further with weak credulous people, than very ſolid reaſons; for people of that ſort e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, if they be curious, think more of a man who will take upon him to tell but ſome things that will be, though the event be of ſmall conſequence; than they will think of a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, judicious man, who can tell them from the word of God what they ſhould do, that they may glorifie and enjoy God; and therefore there is ſuch flocking of people to <hi>Fortune-tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, Speamen, Dummeos, Wizzards</hi> and <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers.</hi> Now if curious people have ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of thoſe who foretel, though they be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have their Knowledge from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, they will think much more of men who are in reputation for Religion; if they take on them to foretel things to come, they will readily be very deſirous that ſuch Predictions may not fail. I know one who preſſed ſome of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintaince to get weapons for fighting in ſuch a year upon this ground, That if there were not Blood that year, then ſuch a perſon who had foretold that there would be Blood, would prove a falſe Prophet.</p>
               <p>Theſe Predictions are very taking, when they ſuit with peoples Inclinations, and when the fulfilling of theſe Predictions contribute to their honour; and when they who are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in fulfilling them, are caſten as ungodly and deſpicable; and therefore theſe Predictions of Miniſters which did foretel, That the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:40126:143" rendition="simple:additions"/> would become deſpicable, could not but be very taking with people who were inclined to deſpiſe it; and this could not but be very ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to preſs them to deſpiſe it, that if they did it not, then they would be known to be none of the godly; and this would preſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to deſpiſe it, that they might not be ranked among the ungodly.</p>
               <p>I have obſerved, that ſeveral have an Art of bringing about ſeveral things by foretelling them; ſome make people offend at theſe things which they would never have offended at, by fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling that the people will be offended. So Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath brought about many miſchiefs by fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling them and the Actors of them; this was a very effectual trick to render the Indulgence deſpicable, to foretel that it would become odious and deteſtable to all the godly; for they who believe theſe Predictions, would reaſon them, If we do not deteſt and hate the Indulgence, we cannot liſt our ſelves among the godly; and then if the Indulged Miniſters did not relinquiſh the Indulgence and hate it, that they could not be reckoned among the godly; and if they did not make haſte to hate it and deteſt it very ſhortly, that then they could not be accounted godly, becauſe this Prediction was to be quickly accompliſhed. It was no great matter to foretell that the Indulgence and indulged Miniſters would become odious, when there was ſo many Letters and Copies of printed Books full of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious reproaches caſt at the Indulgence and Indulged Miniſters, when ſuch cauſes were work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:40126:144"/> and ſuch Fire-balls caſt, and the people were ſo prepared to take fire; it was an eaſie thing without any Spirit of Propheſie, to foretel a Fire when ſuch trains were laid and kindled.</p>
               <p>Again, when a poor Church is going to ruin, the ordinary Forerunner of that ruin, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Miniſters, 2 <hi>Chron. laſt. They mocked the Meſſengers of God, and deſpiſed his words, and miſuſed his Prophets, until the wrath of the Lord roſe againſt his people, till there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou who killeſt the Prophets!</hi> read <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. ver. 34. to the end; ſo that if theſe two Miniſters had ſpoken a little more indefinitely, they might have paſſed for pretty good Gueſſors, if they had ſaid only, that the Indulgence would be deteſtable to the godly; but taking on them to foretel that it would be deteſtable to all the godly, and that quickly, hath quite broken their credit as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; for there are many of the godly who have always been far from deteſting the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; and they are much further from deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it now, than before. And the Authors of theſe Predictions, have by theſe Predictions, and ſome other Practices of that nature, much wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their own Reputation.</p>
               <p>This is ordinary when a Church is going to ruin, the Deſpiſers of the Lords Servants go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; this contempt uſes to begin at ſome, but it ſpreads like Fire; and they who are moſt buſie to bring their Brethren into Contempt, ſuddenly loſe their own Credit; or if they continue a while to take pleaſure in that Fire that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:40126:144"/> their Brethrens reputation, that pleaſure will be readily as ſhort as the pleaſure that an envyful neighbour taketh in warming his hands at the fire which conſumes his neighbours houſe; for the conſuming Fire taking hold of his own houſe, doth quickly ſpill that ſport, and turns the pleaſure into ſorrow and vexation.</p>
               <p>There is yet another piece of high Preſumption in one of theſe Letters, which is ſolidly refuted in a Letter directed to this Hiſtorian; I ſhall ſet it down in the words of that Letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You ſay the ſin of the Indulgence, and of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters throughout the Land favouring it, hath been ſuch an unparallel'd Provocation, as God cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give it till vengeance be proportionably inflicted on the Land and Poſterity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This muſt be indeed a very hainous and great wickedneſs, that is an unparrallel'd provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo that none hath been ſo great before it, nor co-exiſtent to it; but this is a very Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chreſtick Hyperbolie proceeding from exceſſive heat and irritation of Spirit. Is the preaching of an honeſt Miniſter after the removal of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates reſtraint, a greater wickedneſs than whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Inceſts, Witchcrafts, Idolatries, Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that have been or are acted; the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Popery in Doctrine, cruel Maſſacres, Torturing, Death, taught, authorized and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by the Man of Sin, on whoſe forehead are written Abominations? This is an unparral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd exceſs of expreſſions!</p>
               <p>His Hyperbolick exaggeration is very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming upon the Sovereign power of Gods mercy
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:40126:145"/> and will not go well down with thoſe who have ſound and high thoughts of God's Soveraignity; it will be to them <hi>dur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Gods power either of doing or forgiving, is either <hi>potentia abſoluta,</hi> which is conſidered as abſtracted or preſcinded from his Decrees; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther revealed or ſecret; of this we ſuppoſe you do not ſpeak; for if he had not decreed tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral puniſhments, none will ſay, but that God might thave not decreed them, and ſo not executed them, and yet have pardoned the ſin upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt; and this even thoſe who ſay, That primitive Juſtice is eſſential to God, do grant, that as to the egreſſions of it, in its acts on the creature, its free.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Owen</hi> in his <hi>Diatrib. de Jure &amp; Juſtitia Dei</hi> doth yield, and yet he doth very ſtrenuouſly, contrary to <hi>Twiſſe</hi> and <hi>Rutherford,</hi> aſſert, That <hi>primitive Juſtice is eſſential to God, preſcinding from all Decrees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or, 2. <hi>Gods power is</hi> potentia ordinata <hi>by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which is either by his ſecret Decrees, or ſuch as are revealed in his word.</hi> Now as that <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia Dei,</hi> to do or forgive ſin, which is ſecret and not revealed, we are not to ſearch into it, far leſs to determine what it is; and as for that <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia ordinata,</hi> by his Decrees revealed, we ought to ſearch, and may aſſert what we find himſelf determines it to be; ſo that if it be revealed, God will not pardon ſuch a ſin without vengeance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably executed upon the Land and Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; one may ſay, God will not pardon it till ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it is a harſh word, even then and
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:40126:145"/> in that caſe, to ſay God cannot pardon it till venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance be executed; but where is it revealed in the word, That God cannot, or God will not pardon it till vengeance, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> This therefore may ſeem to be great and temerarious boldneſs to be ſo peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour in it; how many great and horrible wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes have been acted, which hath not been viſibly purſued with proportionable vengeance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in this world? And thus to determine how much affinity hath it with Enthuſiaſm, which the Writer hath well confuted in writing againſt the <hi>Quakers;</hi> and therefore we hope doth not with advertency or deliberation fall into it.

               </p>
               <p>I ſhall add the words of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> in his excellent Expoſition of the Book of <hi>Job</hi> pag. 37. where he is ſhewing the errors of <hi>Jobs</hi> three Friends, he reckoneth this among thoſe errors, That they maintained, that there was always an actual exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of ſuch Judgments upon all the wicked in this life. But <hi>Job</hi> agreeably to the Scripture, maintained <hi>That God exerciſes a great variety of diſpenſations towards wicked men in this life,</hi> Chap. 21.23, 24, 25. and as may be gathered from the ſcope of moſt of his ſpeeches, that oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times God ſeeth it fit to ſpare wicked men in this life, yea, and to heap proſperity upon them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til their death, that ſo he may exerciſe the Faith

               <p>Pag. 115.

               <p>It's a wonder how he could imagine to give any, let be all ſatisfaction, or to give any uſual ordinary ſatisfaction; let be all poſſible ſatisfaction, and yet withhold from his Readers the ſtate of the queſtion, without which he can give no ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction at all; no not the leaſt degree of abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary ſatisfaction, which in all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, eſpecially about ſin and duty, ſhould and muſt be given; and far leſs all poſſible ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which takes in not only all that muſt be ſaid, but all that can be ſaid for the Readers ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>The Authors way of handling this queſtion, will give ſatisfaction to none, except they be ſuch as are ſatisfied with ignorance, and confuſion, and vain jangling, underſtanding neither what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm. But though there be no candor, yet there is craft in concealing the true ſtate of the Controverſie, when the cauſe is

If this Author had but prefixed the true ſtate of the queſtion to his Reaſons againſt the accepting of the Indulgence, the many accounts upon which he alledges he hath ſhown the ſinfulneſs of its acceptance, would have come to no account, and all his ſhowing would have been clearly ſeen to be nothing but a vain ſhew.

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If it were a ſin in the Magiſtrate to appoint a Miniſter to preach in ſuch or ſuch a place, and a ſin for the Miniſter to preach, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Magiſtrate appointed him to preach in ſuch a place, then the Miniſters who wrote the firſt Book of Diſcipline, and the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> who approved it, did ſin in deſiring the Magiſtrate to appoint Miniſters to preach in ſuch and ſuch Pariſhes. We did ſhew from the firſt Book of Diſcipline, That they deſired the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to do this and more too, even to compel them to preach.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Author grants in his Anſwer to the third Objection, <hi>That the Magiſtrate may place Miniſters when the Church is corrupt, and all things are out of order;</hi> the vanity of his evaſion by which he ſeeks to elude that Argument taken from the 10th. Chapter of the ſecond Book of Diſcipline, is before diſcovered.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Suppoſe it were unlawful for the Magiſtrate to appoint a Miniſter to exerciſe the Office of the Miniſtry in a particular Pariſh; yet it would not be ſinful for that Miniſter to preach in that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, if the Pariſh were vacant, and earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to exerciſe his Miniſtry among them; and if his preaching there, were not injurious to any; if the Magiſtrates appointing a Miniſter to preach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a Pariſh, render the Miniſters preaching in that Pariſh ſinful, then the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:40126:147"/> by ſuch appointments, might make the exerciſe of the Miniſtry in any Pariſh, or in all Pariſhes in his Dominions, ſinful; which is a moſt abſurd Conceit. Or is it ſinful to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry in ſuch or ſuch Pariſhes, becauſe the Magiſtrate gives them Injunctions and Rules to regulate them in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry?</p>
               <p>But 1. Theſe Injunctions were the Magiſtrates Acts, and not the Miniſters.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Miniſters accepted not of theſe Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but declared they could receive no ſuch Eccleſiaſtick Rules from the Magiſtrate; and that they had full Preſcriptions from Chriſt, which they behoved to obſerve, as they would be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to him of whom they had received their Miniſtry.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Act of Inſtructions, as it was diſtinct from the Act of Indulgence, in which the publick peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry was granted, and came not to the Miniſters hands for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time after they had received the Act of Indulgence; ſo there was a great difference in the nature of the Acts; and the Indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters did right in making uſe of what was good, and refuſing what was evil.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the Magiſtrates ſending Injunctions to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, renders the exerciſe of their Miniſtry ſinful, then the Magiſtrate may render the exerciſe of the Miniſtry in any place, in every place of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions ſinful, by ſending Inſtructions to all the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in his Dominions, which is another abſurd Conceit; which if it were received, would make it
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:40126:148"/> eaſie for an ill-diſpoſed Magiſtrate to mar all preaching by writing and ſending Acts of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to all the Miniſters in his Dominions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The Act of Indulgence flowed from a ſinful Supremacy, and therefore it was ſinful to make any uſe of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> To ſay nothing of the making uſe of a Paſs given by a Captain of Robbers, or of a Covenant of peaceable commerce made with an Uſurper, who hath no juſt title, which Caſuiſts do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn; I anſwer, That that Act which indeed was the Act of Indulgence, and which the Indulged Miniſters made uſe of, <hi>viz.</hi> The Relaxation of the Civil Reſtraint, which hindred the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry, or the granting of the publick peaceable exerciſe of Miniſtry, was no Act of any ſinful Supremacy, but the exerciſe of that power which the Magiſtrate hath from God for doing good.</p>
               <p>As from the right ſtating of the queſtion, it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently appears, That this accepting of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry was not ſinful; ſo it evidently appears, That it was lawful and commendable, and a duty to which they were obliged; as the work of the Miniſtry is a good work, ſo the peaceable ſetled exerciſe of it, under the protection of lawful Authority, is a great mercy, that hath many bleſſings and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages in it; it's a promiſed bleſſing, it's a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for which the people of God ſhould pray; and becauſe the peaceable ſetled exerciſe of the Miniſtry cannot be where Magiſtrates are, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their allowance or permiſſion, therefore it's
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:40126:148"/> duty to pray, That the Lord would incline the heart of Rulers to grant the peaceable publick exerciſe of Religion in their Dominions; and when the Lord inclines the hearts of Rulers to this, we ſhould not ſlight ſuch a promiſed Mercy, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the return of our Prayers, but thankfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this bleſſing of God, conveyed by the hand of the Magiſtrate; and make uſe of this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to the Glory of God, and edification of his Church.</p>
               <p>I remember I have ſpoken before of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the peaceable ſetled exerciſe of the Miniſtry, and of the neceſſity of accepting of it, eſpecially in anſwering the laſt head of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Arguments; and ſhall ſay no more of the ſtate of the queſtion, but this, That they who but underſtand the terms of the queſtion, will ſee, that all the Arguments which the Author brings to prove the accepting of the Indulgence ſinful, do evaniſh as ſmoke, and loſe all colour, when they compere before the light of naked Truth. And they will ſee, that what theſe Miniſters did, in exerciſing their Miniſtry in theſe deſolate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, when the Lord in his good Providence had given them peaceable acceſs thereto, was ſo evidently a religious work, a labour of love, a work of mercy, a ſeaſonable, expedient, neceſſary work, that they will wonder that any do call the lawfulneſs thereof in queſtion.</p>
               <p>If the Author would have done the part of a Candid Diſputant, he ſhould have brought forth all the Arguments made uſe of by the Indulged Miniſters in their full ſtrength; but he brings ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:40126:149"/> of his own Conceits, which he knew beſt how to deal with; and paſſing the ſtrongeſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which were not for his handling, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixes with theſe which he brings, ſomething of his own, which may furniſh him occaſion of ſaying ſomething, though nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt Objection as he propones it, runs thus; <hi>May not the Magiſtrate, for ends known to himſelf, diſcharge Miniſters to preach for a time, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after permit them to preach? and ſeeing the buſineſs of the Indulgence was but of this nature, why might it not be acquieſced unto?</hi> I wonder how he came to alledge the Magiſtrates diſcharging Miniſters to preach in this place, as if the diſcharging to preach were any part of the buſineſs of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, which was not a diſcharging to preach, but the juſt contrary, a permiſſion and allowance to preach? but the Author had ſomething to ſay concerning the Magiſtrates diſcharging of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to preach, that he behoved to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, but he could hardly have deviſed a more impertinent place to ſpeak it, than this. The Magiſtrate ſhould not have hindred theſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to preach, he ſhould not have reſtrained them from preaching, but it was his duty to take off the reſtraint which he had laid on, and to permit them to preach; this was the exerciſe of the power which the Magiſtrate had from God, and therefore the Miniſters might lawfully make uſe of it in accepting this Relaxation of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint formerly laid on, and the peaceable exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Miniſtry; but if he had formed the Argument thus, he would have had nothing to anſwer.</p>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:40126:149"/>
               <p>His firſt anſwer is, <hi>That the Indulgence is a far other thing:</hi> It's true, it's a far other thing than the diſcharging of Miniſters to preach, which he impertinently foiſted in into the Objection; <hi>but,</hi> ſays he, <hi>it's one thing to permit Miniſters to exerciſe their Office without Moleſtation, and it's a far other thing to appoint and order them to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them ſuch or ſuch particular charges.</hi> He does not condemn the Magiſtrates permitting Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to preach, but he hath a quarrel at the Magiſtrates appointing to take ſuch or ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Charges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but if he would have dealt fairly with the Magiſtrate, he ſhould not have foiſted in words of his own, but taken the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates words as they are in the Acts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, in which they do not ſay that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point and order the Miniſters to take upon them ſuch and ſuch particular Charges, but that they appoint them; and in the ſecond Indulgence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and allow them to preach, and exerciſe the other parts of the Miniſterial Function in ſuch a Pariſh. If he quarrel at the Magiſtrates ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing Miniſters to preach at ſuch or ſuch Kirks, he muſt quarrel with the firſt Book of Diſcipline, and much more with the ſecond Book of Diſcipline, which Chap. 10. makes uſe of the word <hi>placing;</hi> but enough of this before.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe that Appointing were not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per term, yet he cannot but acknowledge that the Magiſtrate did in their permitting, allowing, appointing theſe Miniſters to preach at ſuch and ſuch Kirks, really and effectually relax the Civil Reſtraints formerly laid upon theſe Miniſters,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:40126:150"/> which hindred the peaceable publick exerciſe of their Miniſtry in any Pariſh within the Nation, and freed them from the Moleſtation which they would have been obnoxious to, in preaching in ſuch or ſuch Pariſhes before theſe Acts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence; and in ſo far as theſe Acts did relax that undue Reſtraint, they were good; this is ſo evident, that it cannot be with any ſhadow of Reaſon denied. And hence I reaſon thus: When the Magiſtrate doth right in relaxing undue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints which hindered the peaceable publick exerciſe of the Miniſtry, Miniſters may lawfully make uſe of that Relaxation, but the Magiſtrate in permitting, allowing, appointing theſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to preach in ſuch and ſuch Pariſhes, did right in relaxing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore theſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters might lawfully make uſe of that Relaxation. I would gladly hear an anſwer to this Argument: What he ſubjoyns of their plainting and ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Miniſtry in its exerciſe to themſelves, by giving Injunctions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as he foiſts in words of his own, which were not in the Acts of Indulgence, ſo he unreaſonably confounds the Act of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions with the Act of Indulgence, which were Acts in all reſpects diſtinct; the Act of Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was no Act of Indulgence; for theſe Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions were no Indulgence, but clogs ſuperadded; the Act of Indulgence did take off Reſtraints; and that the Miniſters accepted; the Act of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions did lay on Reſtraints, which the Miniſters did not accept of, as was fully manifeſted before. But this is the ordinary fault of this Author, that when he ſhould reaſon againſt the Indulgence,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:40126:150"/> as it was accepted by the Miniſters, or againſt their pactice in accepting the Releaxation and the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of lawful Authority, he falls to ſpeak of what was wrong in the Magiſtrates acting, to which the Indulged Miniſters had no acceſſion: but ye muſt excuſe him; for if he had not done this, he would have had nothing to ſay; and yet it had been much better to have ſaid nothing, than to have ſpoken ſo impertinently, and ſo injuriouſly, in charging the indulged Miniſters with the fault that they had no acceſſion to. If the Authors reaſonings were reduced to form, they would be very ridiculous; as for example, the Magiſtrates Act of Inſtructions which laid on wrong reſtraints, was not right; and therefore the Magiſtrates Act of Indulgence which took off wrong Reſtraints, was not right.</p>
               <p>Again, the Magiſtrate ſhould not have made the Act of Inſtructions, and thefore the Miniſters ſhould not have made uſe of the Act of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; <hi>Baculus ſtat in angulo, ergo pluit;</hi> the Club ſtands in the Corner, and therefore it rains. This third Argument is as good as the other two; and yet of ſuch Sand-ropes are the Arguings of this Author twiſted. Before I leave this, I cannot but ſuſpect, that all that the Author ſeems to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to the Magiſtrate, at leaſt to our Magiſtrates in reference to the exerciſe of the Office of the Miniſtry, is this, That they ſhould permit and not moleſt Miniſters in the exerciſe of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; for he is againſt their appointing of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to preach at ſuch or ſuch a Kirk; I am
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:40126:151"/> the more confirmed in this by ſome paſſages of the <hi>Cup of cold Water,</hi> and ſome late actings; if this be his Opinion, it is a new one: for all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Divines; and the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> in the ſecond Book of Diſcipline, Chap. 1. maintains, That the Civil power ſhould command the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual to exerciſe; and in that ſame Chapter it's granted, That the Magiſtrate ought to command the Miniſters to obſerve the Rule commanded in the word, and puniſh the Tranſgreſſors by civil means; if he aſcribe no more to our Magiſtrates but this, That they ſhould meerly permit, or not moleſt, or as the <hi>Cup of cold Water</hi> hath it, pag. 42. forbear to perſecute the Mediators Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors; he gives no more to the Magiſtrate, than is given to a ſtrong Captain of Robbers, who hath Miniſters under his power, and at his diſpoſal, which were moſt abſurd. But even upon this abſurd ſuppoſition, That the Magiſtrate might not command, or appoint Miniſters to preach; and that appointing were an overſtretch, yet even upon this ſuppoſition, the Miniſters might lawfully after this appointment of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, have gone to thoſe Pariſhes, to which they were appointed to go, upon the earneſt deſire of thoſe deſtitute people. I clear it by this ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: Suppoſe a Captain of Robbers hath by force ſubdued an Iſland, in which there are two Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and four diſtinct Pariſhes, this Uſurper commands theſe Miniſters to be brought before him, and tells them he will not ſuffer them to return to their former Charges, but appoints them to preach at the two vacant Churches,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:40126:151"/> though he have no Authority to appoint them to preach in theſe two other Pariſhes, yet theſe Miniſters having no acceſs to their own Pariſhes, being debarred by ſtrong hand, might upon the earneſt deſire of the two vacant Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, go and help them till they might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to their own Pariſhes; and their doing ſo, would be no owning of the Authority of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Robbers to appoint; and it were but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſay to that Captain, If ye only ſuffer us to go, it may be we will go; but if ye appoint us, we will not go at all; for that were but the way to hinder themſelves from all exerciſe of their Office, and deprive the whole Iſland of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Goſpel; or if that Captain ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point or command a Phyſitian to make his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in ſuch a Town of the Iſland, or elſe he would not ſuffer him to exerciſe his Calling in the Iſland; the Phyſitians going, would be no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment that the Captain had a lawful Authority to command or appoint him; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the Miniſtry and of Medicine, are works of neceſſity and mercy, and ſo neceſſary in order to the Glory of God, and the good of man, that whenever and wherever they who are called and fitted of God to exerciſe their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, have lawful acceſs to do theſe works of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and mercy, they ſhould not neglect the occaſion; and it's a Phantaſtick and Childiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit to think, that if men who have no Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over Miniſters or Phyſitians, or they who have lawful Authority, but claim more in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Miniſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than God hath given
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:40126:152"/> them; if they take upon them a power in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Miniſters, which they have not; and in a way not competent to them, appoint Miniſters or Phyſitians to do the work of the Miniſtry or Medicine, which God (antecedently to any thing that thoſe who uſurp upon them, do in reference to them) hath called them to. I ſay it's a Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick and Childiſh Conceit to think, That ſuch Uſurpations can make void the call which they have from God, to do thoſe works of neceſſity and mercy, when they have acceſs thereunto without doing Injury to any.</p>
               <p>His 2, 3, 4. Anſwers about the Magiſtrates diſcharging Miniſters to preach, are in anſwer to what he was pleaſed impertinently to object to himſelf; That the Magiſtrate may for ends known to himſelf, diſcharge Miniſters to preach; and ſo though the purpoſe in his Anſwers be good, yet they are nothing to the purpoſe in this place. I have only one queſtion anent ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what he ſaith. In the end of his 4th. Anſwer he grants in the beginning of it, <hi>That the Magiſtrate may indirectly and conſequently ſilence a Miniſter for a civil Crime, as</hi> Solomon <hi>did</hi> Abiathar; but he ſays, <hi>For an Eccleſiaſtick Tranſgreſſion, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate cannot indirectly or conſequently remove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Miniſter from the exerciſe of his Miniſtry, where the Church is ſetled in his power; except only cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſative, by commanding the Church-Judicatories to do their work.</hi> Firſt, that is firſt to judge: for <hi>in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma inſtantia,</hi> he may not do it; or corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively, by backing the Service of the Church-Judicatory with his Civil Sanction and Authority.
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:40126:152"/> Now my queſtion is, Suppoſe a Magiſtrate hath commanded a Church-Judicatory to take courſe with a Miniſter who preaches Hereſie or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine tending to Idolatry, or preaches Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick-Doctrine, and rents the Church; and yet the Church-Judicatory through Ignorance or being themſelves tainted, or through want of Zeal, take no effectual courſe to remedy theſe evils; this is a caſe ſuppoſable: for we ſee the Church-Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of <hi>Pergamus</hi> ſuffered them that held the Doctrine of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and that held the Doctrine of the <hi>Nicclatians,</hi> and the Church-Judicatory of <hi>Thyatria,</hi> ſuffered the Woman <hi>Jezabel,</hi> that called her ſelf a Propheteſs, to teach and ſeduce the Servants of God to commit Fornication, and to eat things ſacrificed to Idols; in this caſe ſhall the Magiſtrate do no more but command the Church-Judicatory to their work? He hath done that, and yet the Judicatory does nothing, or nothing to purpoſe; and the Church is like to be undone through theſe Doctrines that fret like a Gangreen. And the other member of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction makes no help: for the Church-Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, I ſuppoſe, paſſes no right ſentence which the Magiſtrate may corroborate; ſhall he who is Gods Vicegerent ſuffer the people of God, and his Subjects, to be poiſoned with damnable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? may he do nothing indirectly to reſtrain theſe Hereticks from preaching ſuch damnable Doctrines? and therefore it ſeems, that though the Magiſtrate cannot depoſe an Heretick that's a Miniſter, yet he may do more to reſtrain a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritick from deſtroying the people of God, than
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:40126:153"/> is comprehended within the members of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of cauſatively and corroboratively; and he himſelf ſeems to grant with <hi>Voetius</hi> in his Anſwer to the ſecond Objection, <hi>That the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate may hinder an Heretick from preaching Hereſie either publickly, or from houſe to houſe</hi>—</p>
               <p>As for his ſecond Objection, if he had formed it thus: When the Magiſtrate granteth the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able publick exerciſe of the Miniſtry, Miniſters ſhould thankfully accept of this grant, he would have had no Anſwer; but he kept out peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able out of the Objection; and then he anſwers, that the Magiſtrate ſhould not diſcharge the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick exerciſe of the Miniſtry; well, but what is that to the purpoſe? will he infer from thence, that therefore he ſhould not allow to Miniſters the publick peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry?</p>
               <p>The third Objection he proponeth thus; Our ſecond Book of Diſcipline granteth, <hi>That Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates may place Miniſters when the Kirk is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and all things out of order;</hi> and ſo it is now with us. The Argument may be framed thus; if the Magiſtrate when the Church is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and all things out of order, may place Miniſters, then the Magiſtrate may appoint, permit, allow Miniſters to preach in ſuch and ſuch Kirks; For if the Magiſtrate may do what is more, then they may do what is leſs in the corrupt ſtate of the Church; But the ſtate of the Church is ſuch: and therefore if the Magiſtrate may in this caſe place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he may much more permit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He grants all the major is evident from the place cited; and he grants it to the minor, which was as he
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:40126:153"/> proponed it, but ſo it is now with us; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, that our Church was a conſtituted and well-ordered Church— but that now Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is come, and ſo in effect he yields all; but I remember he ſpoke to this before. What he ſays of the Magiſtrates bringing on this Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is no evaſion; for the Book of Diſcipline does ſpeak generally of a Church corrupted, whatever way it hath been corrupted, whether by Magiſtrates or Miniſters, that's neither up nor down. A Magiſtrate that hath diſordered the Church, is ſo much the more obliged to right thoſe diſorders; and if a Magiſtrate hath diſordered the Church by thruſting Miniſters from the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry, he ought to retract what he hath done, by allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the peaceable exerciſe of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; if he did wrong in thruſting them out, it's right to let them in; and the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in that place cited, hath declared, That in that caſe Miniſters ſhould not refuſe to preach in any place, becauſe the Magiſtrate hath inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his Authority for ſetling them. He inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates in the end of this Anſwer, That this Conceſſion gives the Magiſtrate all Church-power; but this is a groundleſs and injurious alledgance; the Authors of that Book, and the General Aſſemblie's, which after exact examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every part of it, concluded it to be ſubſcribed by every Miniſter of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> underſtood the Nature of Church-power much better than he did; and they were ſo far from thinking, That the Magiſtrates
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:40126:154"/> who in the corrupt and diſordered ſtate of the Church, interpoſes their Civil Authority for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Miniſters, does in ſo doing aſſume unto themſelves, and exerciſe all Church-power; that they commend what they did in that caſe as a practice well-becoming godly Kings, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Emperors. This Inſinuation is highly injurious to thoſe wiſe and godly men who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled and approved, ſubſcribed that ſecond Book of Diſcipline; for if this Conceſſion did yield all Church-power to the Magiſtrate, then thoſe who compiled and ſubſcribed it, do quite ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert what they had immediately aſſerted, <hi>viz. That the Magiſtrate may not uſurp any thing which belongs not to the civil Sword, but belongs to the Offices which are meerly Eccleſiaſtical, as is the Miniſtry of the Word and Sacraments, uſing Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Diſcipline, and the Spiritual Execution thereof, or any part of the power of the Spiritual Keys which our Maſter gave to the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors:</hi> As it cannot be ſuppoſed, that ſo wiſe men would ſo quickly contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a Book ſo deliberately, and after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Debates concluded; ſo it cannot be imagined, that they would deſign Kings and Princes godly for doing that which would quite ſwallow up, and ſubvert the holy Calling of the Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>This one paſſage in the ſecond Book of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, does quite ruine the cauſe of the Author of the Hiſtory of the Indulgence, and approves the practice of the Indulged Miniſters; ſo that what they have done, they have done it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the mind of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:40126:154"/> expreſſed in the ſecond Book of Diſcipline. The Book ſays, <hi>That godly Kings both in the old and in the light of the New Teſtament, have placed Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters when the Kirk was corrupted,</hi> &amp;c. This not only may be, but it hath been; and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor denies not that the Church was corrupted at the time of the Indulgence, and all things out of order and in confuſion; and thus he really yields the cauſe, and concedes all; when the Church is corrupted, and all things out of order, the Magiſtrate may place Miniſters, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters may be placed by Magiſtrates; but at the time of the Indulgence, as the Author grants, the Church was corrupted, and all things out of order; and therefore at the time of the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, the Magiſtrate might place Miniſters, and Miniſters might be placed by Magiſtrates according to the 10th. Chapter of the ſecond Book of Diſcipline. It's true, that the Magiſtrate ſhould not have broken the order of the Church; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Neither doth the acceptance of the peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry from the Magiſtrate (who had formerly reſtrained Miniſters by penal Statutes, that they could not without moleſtation exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their Miniſtry) teach Magiſtrates a way how to uſurp all Church-power; for the taking off of Reſtraints, was a doing of right, and no Uſurpation. He might as well alledge, That if one by ſtrong hand wound a man, and put him out of his own houſe, and take his Goods, and afterward be willing to cure the wound, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the man to return to his Houſe and Goods, that the injured man by admitting the Cure, and returning to his own Houſe and Goods, teaches the man who injured him, to wound, intrude and ſpoil.</p>

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:40126:155"/> and Miniſters may and ſhould obey ſuch Commands; but the former is true, for theſe Kings are commended for doing ſo, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.2. &amp;c. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.2, 3, 4, 5. &amp;c. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31.2. and therefore the latter is true alſo.</p>
               <p>He anſwers, <hi>That our Rulers have done many evil things which theſe Kings did not;</hi> but will he conclude, that becauſe they have done evil which theſe Kings did not, that therefore they may not imitate theſe Kings in doing good, in permitting, allowing, commanding Miniſters to preach the Goſpel, and do the other parts of their Miniſterial Office? this was the Act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence which the Indulged Miniſters made uſe of; and the Magiſtrate in this Act did not deſtroy the Order and Beauty of the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Author in his Anſwer would make his Reader believe, That they who make uſe of this Argument, bring it to prove that the Magiſtrate might make the Act of Inſtructions; but it hath been often anſwered, That the Act of Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was not the Act of Indulgence; the Act of Indulgence permitted and allowed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their Miniſtry; of this Act they made uſe; the Act of Inſtructions which was ſuper-added to the Act of Indulgence, the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſters did not obſerve, and told the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate they could not receive ſuch Inſtructions.</p>
               <p>I am wearied of theſe Repetitions; the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, Whether the Magiſtrate may command Miniſters to do the work of their Miniſterial Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? the Queſtion is concluded in the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:40126:156"/> That they may from the Scriptures cited; and if they may command, they may permit and allow them to preach, and do the other Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Miniſtry. He diverts his Reader from conſidering the force of the Argument, by making a Compariſon betwixt <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> and other Rulers; as if this were the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of thoſe who argue from the forecited Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, to prove that our Rulers were as godly Reformers as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Joſiah;</hi> but this is but a trick to eſcape the dint of the Argument: As we ſhould mourn, that neither our Rulers nor we, are like thoſe eminently holy Kings, who were very ſingular for uprightneſs and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and pray that the Lord who hath the hearts of Rulers and Subjects in his hand, would give them and us ſuch uprightneſs and tenderneſs as thoſe Kings had; ſo when our Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers do any thing for which thoſe Kings were commended, we ſhould thankfully acknowledge it; and this is one of thoſe things for which they are commended, That they commanded the Prieſts and Levites to do their work; and is not preaching and the exerciſe of the other Functions of the Miniſtry, the work of the Miniſters of the Goſpel? and if it was good, and a part of the Reformation of thoſe godly Kings, to command this, why ſhould it be judged evil in our Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to do what they did?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 5. But what can be ſaid of ſuch of the Indulged, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> the Argument may be formed thus; When the Magiſtrate appoints, permits, allows Miniſters to go to their own Charges to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:40126:156"/> their Miniſterial Office, Miniſters may lawfully go, yea, they ſhould go to their own Charges; but the Magiſtrate appointed thoſe Miniſters whom the Objection concerns, to go to their own Charges, to exerciſe their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Office, and therefore they might lawfully go, and it was their duty to go.</p>
               <p>He anſwers, 1. <hi>That it was a meer accidental thing that they were ſent to their own charges,</hi> viz. <hi>becauſe at that time they were vacant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. He puts in his own word of ſending, and not the words uſed in the Acts of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, which is not fair dealing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What means he by a meer accidental thing? if he mean that the Council did not intend that they ſhould go to their own Charges, but that this fell out beſide the Magiſtrates intent, this is falſe; for as it was appointed by the Kings Majeſty, That they ſhould return to preach and exerciſe the other Functions of the Miniſtry in the Pariſh-Churches where they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſerved; ſo the Council appointed them to go to theſe Churches; and therefore their going thither was not beſide the intent of the Magiſtrate, but was a thing deſigned and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Magiſtrate: Their going to their former Charges, was not in reſpect of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, like the finding of a Treaſure by a man who is plowing the ground.</p>
               <p>But 3ly. Suppoſe this had been a meer acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, will this militate againſt theſe Miniſters returning to their own Charges? It was acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental that thoſe Pariſhes were vacant, and
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:40126:157"/> therefore it was unlawful for theſe Miniſters to return to their own vacant Pariſhes; had not theſe Pariſhes been vacant, theſe Miniſters had been appointed either to go elſewhere, or had not been indulged at all; and therefore it was unlawful for them to return to thoſe Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations which were accidentally vacant. Theſe are reaſonings which have no ſhadow of Reaſon; but the Subject-matter could not furniſh him with any better.</p>
               <p>But it would ſeem from pag. 19. That he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes accidental, to that which is neceſſary, and cannot be otherways than it is; for when he is proving, that this was an accidental thing, he labours to make it appear by Mr. <hi>John Park</hi> his diſappointment, becauſe the Prelate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his coming to the Kirk deſigned, by thruſting in a Curate, notwithſtanding of his pleading the benefit of the Act of indempnity in his own defence, againſt what was objected againſt him, and thereby acknowledged himſelf to have been a Traytor in all his former actings, and that all the work of Reformation was but Rebellion. Here the Author grants, That Mr. <hi>John Park's</hi> own Kirk was deſigned for him, and ſo his accidental thing is not here oppoſed to a deſigned thing, but to a thing that is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that it cannot be hindred or prevented; and if he take <hi>accidental</hi> in this ſenſe, the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt run thus; The returning of Miniſters to their own Charge was not a neceſſary thing, which muſt be, and cannot but be; but only a contingent thing, which may not be, and whoſe
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:40126:157"/> being may be prevented; and therefore it was not a thing lawful, or a duty. But this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is as ridiculous, if not more ridiculous than the former; for there are many things which may lawfully be, and ſhould be, which yet never have any exiſtence. I doubt not but the Reverend Brother, Mr. <hi>John Park,</hi> can abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly clear himſelf from the foul aſperſions that this Author would caſt upon him. I know not the Matter of fact, which might yield many grounds of defence; but it ſeems the Author hath been too intent, to have a hit at Mr. <hi>Park,</hi> ſeeing he brings, or rather impertinently drags him upon the Stage to be beaten; and that becauſe he pleaded the benefit of an Act of Indempnity. It ſeems very unreaſonable and injurious dealing to alledge, That any man who pleads to have the benefit of an Act of Indemnity as it doth free a man from Skaith and Damage, doth hereby acknowledg, that he hath been a Traytor in all his former actings, or that he acknowledges any real crime at all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Says he, <hi>They were not barely permitted to go to their own Charges by reſcinding of the Act of</hi> Glaſgow, <hi>or taking off the Sentence of Baniſhment; which might eaſily have been done, if the Council had intended no actual Invaſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> They were not barely permitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their own Charges, and therefore they ſhould not have returned. The Council intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an actual Invaſion in their returning, and therefore the Miniſters ſinned in returning. I am
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:40126:158"/> wearied in repeating ſuch Arguments that are ſo palpably abſurd.</p>
               <p>His 3d. is, <hi>That their right to their former Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, is nothing but the Councils Order and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> This is a manifeſt falſhood; the Councils Act gave them acceſs to the peaceable uſe of the right which they formerly had.</p>
               <p>His 4th. <hi>That their caſe was worſe than the caſe of other indulged Miniſters; and that they did renounce their old right to the exerciſe of their Miniſtry;</hi> but how proves he that? very eaſily, <hi>viz.</hi> by ſaying it. Theſe things are ſo abſurd and groſs, and are ſo far from having any ſhadow of Reaſon, that to repeat them, is to refute them; and the truth is, they are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of repetition, let be of Refutation.</p>
               <p>His 5th. <hi>And why may they not alſo repair to Presbyteries and Synods, upon the Councils order?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> If the Magiſtrate would ſet up Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Government by Presbyteries and Synods, would he have Miniſters refuſe to go to theſe Presbyteries and Synods? if he mean Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Synods Prelatically conſtitute, in which the Prelatick Power is exerciſed, and they who conſtitute themſelves Members of theſe Courts, own the Prelatick Power which gives them their being; his Queſtion is impertinent; for there is a great diſparity betwixt a Miniſters going to a Court Prelatically conſtituted, and going to preach to his own Pariſh. The Magiſtrates diſcharge doth not invalidate the right that Miniſters have to meet in Presbyteries and Synods; but it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the peaceable uſe of that right.</p>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:40126:158"/>
               <p>The 6th. <hi>Object.</hi> He propones thus; <hi>If it be a ground ſufficient to reject the benefits of the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, becauſe it is ſuppoſed to flow from the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy; then much more more might we refuſe to preach if the Magiſtrate ſhould command it expreſly by virtue of his Supremacy; and if this be yielded, then it is manifeſt, that if the Magiſtrate had a mind to baniſh all preaching out of his Dominions, he needeth uſe no other</hi> medium <hi>than only tell the Miniſters, That he commanded them to preach by virtue of his Supremacy.</hi> This is a piece of one of the Arguments made uſe of by the Indulged Miniſters: it may be formed thus; <hi>If the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel may not lawfully preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in any place where the Magiſtrate who claims to himſelf a Spiritual Supremacy, appoints or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits them to preach; and if Miniſters may not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preach the Goſpel, if Magiſtrates command them, by virtue of their Spiritual Supremacy, to preach it, and write Eccleſiaſtical Inſtructions and Injunctions to regulate them; then the Magiſtrate may, if he be ſo diſpoſed, eaſily baniſh all preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of his Dominions, by writing Papers, in which he claims the ſaid Supremacy, and ſets down Injunctions,</hi> &amp;c. But this latter is moſt abſurd; and therefore ſo is the former; the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of this, that the Magiſtrate by his claiming to himſelf a Spiritual Supremacy, and giving In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to Miniſters, which is his proper deed, which the Miniſters cannot hinder, and to which they have no acceſſion, can make Miniſters preaching unlawful; I ſay, the abſurdity of this conceit is ſo evident, that any who have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:40126:159"/> ſenſe, and will make uſe of it, may clearly perceive it. Now let us hear what he anſwers:</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſays, That <hi>he hath ſeen and manifeſted, that the Indulgence hath a real relation to, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon the Supremacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> He hath never manifeſted, That the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, as it was accepted, hath any ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon any unlawful Supremacy; or that the Magiſtrates Acts, which were indeed the Acts of Indulgence, <hi>viz.</hi> his appointing, permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, allowing Miniſters of the Goſpel to preach the Goſpel, flow from any unlawful Supremacy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſays, That <hi>he hath adduced many other heads of Arguments againſt it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Theſe many heads are cut off in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers before adduced.</p>
               <p>In his 3d. he grants, That <hi>the command to preach ſimply, cannot be ſaid to flow from, nor to have ſuch a dependance upon this uſurped Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; for to command Miniſters to do their duty in preaching the Goſpel according to the Command of God, belongs to the Power which God hath granted to the Magiſtrate, and ſo natively floweth from his Office.</hi> Now ſeeing the Author hath granted this, I hope he will no more quarrel at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence upon the account of the Magiſtrates uſing the word <hi>appointing</hi> Miniſters to preach; for <hi>commanding</hi> is at leaſt as much as <hi>appointing.</hi> He adds, <hi>But to ſet down Limitations, Reſtrictions and Conditions, regulating the exerciſe of the Miniſtry, doth not ſo flow; and when they are ſuch as are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the Rules of Chriſt, it muſt of neceſſity be by virtue of an uſurped power; whence it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:40126:159"/> That this Indulgence, containing ſuch limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>doth not flow from the Office of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It hath been often anſwered, That the Act of Inſtructions was an Act diſtinct from the Act of Indulgence; and the Miniſters did never accept the Inſtructions, and gave Reaſons to the Magiſtrate why they could accept of no ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, as was ſhewed before. He adds, <hi>Therefore though in the caſe of ſimple preaching, the Injunction uſhered in with an expreſs mention of the Supremacy, as it's ground and riſe, would be but a ridiculous Scarcrow; yet in this other caſe, which is the caſe of the Indulgence, it would be an open ſpreading of the Net in the ſight of the Bird, and more than a ſufficient warning for wiſe men to beware.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> If the Supremacy ſet before the Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to preach the Goſpel, be but a ridiculous Scarcrow, that ſhould not hinder Miniſters from preaching it; then certainly the Act of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which was ſet behind the Injunction to preach the Goſpel, is as ridiculous a Scarcrow, and ſhould hinder no Miniſter from doing the work of the Miniſtry; yea, it ſeems more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous: for the Scarcrow of the Supremacy is by the Author ſuppoſed to be before the Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of preaching; but this Scarcrow of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions comes behind the injunction of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now thoſe Scarcrows which are betwixt Crows and the Corn, ſcars them more than thoſe Scarcrows which are beyond the Corn. And if Miniſters need not ſcar at the Injunction of
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:40126:160"/> preaching, though the Magiſtrate wrapt in his Supremacy in the Injunction, then Miniſters need far leſs ſcar at any Injunction to preach the Goſpel, becauſe there is another Act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions lying at ſome diſtance from it; for if judicious Miniſters may and ſhould make uſe of the good injunction to preach the Goſpel, though the Magiſtrate did endeavour to wrap his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Supremacy in it; if they may untwiſt his Act, and take the Injunction, and leave his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Supremacy, as having nothing to do with it; I am ſure they may far more eaſily take the Injunction to preach, and leave the Act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, which is not twiſted in with it; but as it was diſtinct in it's Nature, ſo it lay at a pretty diſtance from it; <hi>but,</hi> ſays he, <hi>this is an open ſpreading of the Net in the ſight of the Bird.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The more open it be, there is the leſs hazard, except men be more ſilly than Birds, who do not uſe to intangle themſelves in a Net that's openly ſpread in their ſight; and therefore crafty Fowlers uſe to hide their Snares.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Supremacy which he ſuppoſes to be wrapped in with the Injunction to preach, is as open a Snare; and if folk would be ſcarred without Reaſon, they would have a fairer pretence for making no uſe of an Injunction to preach, uſhered in with, and founded upon a Spiritual Supremacy; than for making no uſe of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction to preach, becauſe of another Act of Injunction, which, as it hath no connexion in nature with the Injunction to preach, ſo it hath not ſo much as a connexion in the Contexture of
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:40126:160"/> the Magiſtrates Act, being framed in a diſtinct Act. He adds, <hi>This is more than a ſufficient warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Wiſe men to beware.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> But of what? I hope not of preaching the Goſpel; and yet he muſt ſay this, or he ſays nothing to the purpoſe here; for if he mean of the Inſtructions, this makes no difference betwixt this caſe and the former; for ſo muſt Miniſters beware of the Spiritual Supremacy, by which the Injunction of preaching is uſhered in; but yet the Author would not have Miniſters ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at preaching, becauſe of the Supremacy; no more ſhould they beware of preaching, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Inſtructions.</p>
               <p>In his 4th. he ſays, <hi>Though a command to preach according to the Rules of Chriſt, cannot be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to flow from this corrupt Supremacy, even though the Magiſtrate ſhall ſay ſo much in plain terms; yet a command to preach in this place, and not in another place; and to preach ſo and ſo accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch Limitations, Rules and Preſcriptions, and according to no other, as it is in the caſe of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, may be ſaid to flow natively from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Supremacy</hi>—And ſo he infers the accepting of the Indulgence cannot be juſtified, though in the granting of it, no mention was made of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, much leſs if this were expreſly prefixed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. As to the matter of fact, the Author miſrepreſents the Magiſtrates Act of Indulgence; for though the Magiſtrates appointed, permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, allowed the Miniſters to preach in ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet they did not command them to preach in no other place. Again, though they gave
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:40126:161"/> Limitations and Preſcriptions, yet they never limit the Miniſters ſo to theſe Preſcriptions, as to exclude all other Preſcriptions. Seeing he had a mind to make ſuch terrible Amplifications, he did not wittily in ſetting down the Acts of Indulgence, which are a ſufficient refutation of thoſe additions which he hath made to them. If any alledge, that the Magiſtrate confined them, and that reſtrained them from preaching in any other place; the Author anſwereth, p. 116. <hi>That the Magiſtrate by baniſhing and confining, may conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and indirectly ſilence Miniſters, as</hi> Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>removed</hi> Abiathar <hi>from the Prieſthood.</hi> Now this was a worſe confinement than that of the Indulged Miniſters in this reſpect, becauſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biathar</hi> could not exerciſe the Prieſts Office but at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> from which <hi>Solomon</hi> baniſht him; but the Indulged Miniſters not only might, but they might without hazard, preach in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes to which they were confined; but though he grant this, yet he denieth that the Magiſtrate can directly diſcharge Miniſters to preach; and therefore the Act of Confinement will not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant what he ſays here, That the Magiſtrate commanded them to preach in one place, and not in another; if they preach in another place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide that to which they are indulged, they run a hazard; but the Magiſtrate hath not in the Act o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="331" facs="tcp:40126:161"/> floweth from a corrupt Supremacy; yea, he hath granted, according to the tenth Chapter of the ſecond Book of Diſcipline, That the Magiſtrate may in ſome caſes place Miniſters; the Miniſters who went to their own Pariſhes had the antecedent Judgment of the Church at their Ordination, for preaching in ſuch Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and the Magiſtrate in appointing them to go thither, appointed them to do what the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery had before ordained them to; they who went to other Churches than their own, as they had the antecedent Judgment of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> in that tenth Chapter of the ſecond Book of Diſcipline, to warrant their Act; ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they went to the Council, they had the advice of, or conſent of the generality of the outed Miniſters to do what they did; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they went to theſe Pariſhes, they had In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations from the reſpective Congregations.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As for the Inſtructions, enough hath been ſaid before; they were not the Act of Indulgence which the Miniſters made uſe of; and therefore whatever be the fountain whence they flowed, the Indulged Miniſters are not defiled, ſeeing they drank not of thoſe ſtreams.</p>
               <p>But 4ly. The Author hath forgot the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he ſhould have anſwered; he doth not evite the abſurdity of the baniſhing all preaching out of the Land, mentioned in the end of the Objection he propoſed; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall again reſume it; for ſuppoſe that it were not only unlawful for Magiſtrates to give Inſtructions, but alſo to appoint or permit Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters

But firſt, to leave Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to determine and clear themſelves from the viſible ends of Magiſtrates, which again are to be known from ſeveral Circumſtances, looks rather like the Advice of a Politician, than the ſolid advice of a Divine to honeſt ſimple Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.

I would not have noticed this, if I had not heard it regrated by many, that by Directions of this kind, ſimple people are brought to intangle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the intreigues of State, and to gueſs at the deſigns of Stateſ-men, and to counter-work the deſigns which they gueſs the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate hath againſt them; and thus while they ſhould be conferring upon the word of God, upon the chief end of man, and the means that leads to that end, they waſte their time in gueſſing at the Magiſtrates ends, and in ſetting the World upon Stoups, and parts more fooliſh and confuſed than when they met.</p>

He grants in the firſt caſe, <hi>That the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates Intention is to root out the Goſpel, though it be manifeſted by him, ſhould not hinder the Miniſters from obeying the Magiſtrates Command to preach.</hi> This Conceſſion overturns all his former rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings from the Magiſtrates bad intentions; for if this be true, that when the thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Magiſtrate is good, it may be done though the Magiſtrate command it by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of an uſurped Supremacy, and command it for an ill end, <hi>viz.</hi> the rooting out of the Goſpel; then the Magiſtrates aſſumed Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy by which he commands, and his evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign for which he commands the preaching
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:40126:163"/> of the Goſpel does not vitiate the Miniſters preaching of the Goſpel; and thus a great part of his Book is by his own conceſſion evaniſhed in ſmoke, and all the Batteries he hath raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Indulged Miniſters upon theſe grounds of the Magiſtrates Spiritual Supremacy, and evil deſigns, hath been a building of Caſtles in the Air; and hence it appears, That the bad circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Magiſtrates actings, in permitting, allowing, commanding Miniſters to preach the Goſpel, does not vitiate the Miniſters preaching of the Goſpel; who as they do not approve of what is wrong in the Magiſtrates acting, nor have any acceſſion to the wrong Principles and ends of the Magiſtrate; ſo they preach the Goſpel upon right Principles, and for right ends.</p>
               <p>I ſee the Author can allow Miniſters in ſome caſes to abſtract good from evil, to obey what is good in the Magiſtrates command, and leave what is evil in the Principles upon which, and the end for which he commands; why did he then gybe at the Indulged Miniſters for making ſuch Metaphyſical abſtractions, as if they had not been manly, or ſuch as became honeſt men and Miniſters? but now he himſelf hath ſpoilt all the ſport that was in theſe gybings; and as he hath expoſed himſelf to laughter, alledging that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p n="3">3. I argue from his Conceſſion, If all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in the Magiſtrates Dominions may obey the Magiſtrates Command to preach, though it be uſhered in with an uſurped Supremacy, and deſigned for an ill end; then ſome of theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters may do what all of them might have done; for few, as well as many, may chuſe the good and leave the ill; why ſhould the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel be ſinful to a few Miniſters, if it be lawful to all? what if the Magiſtrates had commanded all the Miniſters that were out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to preach, except one or two, would it have been ſinful to them to preach ſo long as theſe two were excepted. I ſuppoſe no ſober perſon will ſay ſo, and yet the deduction of theſe two, mars the Univerſality; for if two be excepted, then all are not commanded to preach; ſuppoſe the total ſum of theſe Miniſters were 42. ſhall the Magiſtrate excepting or paſſing by 2, or 10, or 20, or 30 of the 40, render it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the 38, or 30, or 20, or 10, whom he indulges, to preach? if the paſſing by of two makes it not unlawful for the 38 to preach, why ſhould the paſſing by of 10, or 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> render it unlawful to the reſt to preach? muſt the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs or unlawfulneſs of preaching be calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by Arithmetick figures? This is a new uſe of Arithmetick, that I ſuppoſe <hi>Marcheſton</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf never imagined. If the accepting of one or two, does not make it ſinful for the reſt to preach when the Magiſtrate commands them,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:40126:164"/> would know if the exception of 4. or 8, will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it unlawful to the reſt to preach? and if not, where ſhall we ſiſt? what is the number that will alter the morality of preaching, and turn what was right, to be wrong? who can determine the <hi>maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum quod ſic,</hi> or the <hi>minimum quod ſic,</hi> the preciſe number <hi>quo non datur ultra?</hi> but enough of this.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What he adds to make the caſe of the few different from the caſe of all, <hi>viz.</hi> That the few are commanded to preach here and there, and Limitations and Reſtrictions ſuperadded to the Command, ſhould have been added in the firſt caſe, if he would have dealt fairly, and to have encountered the Argument in its full ſtrength; but he framed the firſt ſuppoſed caſe ſo, as he might make a way for himſelf to eſcape; but he muſt not go ſo. I ſhall therefore reinforce the Argument thus. If it be unlawful for all the Miniſters, or all the outed Miniſters in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to preach the Goſpel, if the Magiſtrate by virtue of an uſurped Supremacy, and for an ill end, command them to preach here and there and under ſuch and ſuch Limitations and Reſtrictions; then a Magiſtrate by ſuch a Command without any more ado, may baniſh all preaching out of his Dominions; but the latter is abſurd, and ſo is the former. I ſee not how upon his Principles this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity can be evited; for if a few Miniſters may not lawfully preach, if they be ſo commanded and reſtricted, how can many preach lawfully, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f ſo commanded and reſtricted? but ye will ſay, there is a great difference betwixt many and few; I grant there is an Arithmetical difference,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:40126:165"/> but it's nothing to the preſent purpoſe; for if the Reſtrictions do vitiate the preaching of a few, it will alſo vitiate the preaching of many; for moral filth is not like natural filth, dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by ſpreading, but is rather encreaſed. If it be ſaid, That, if all Miniſters were ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to preach, they might fruſtrate the Magiſtrates ill Intentions, and ſinful Inſtructions, by driving on the great deſign of the Goſpel, and obſerving Chriſts Inſtructions. I anſwer; A few of them might do the ſame; what ſhould hinder a few of them to do what all may do?</p>
               <p n="5">5. If a ſmall number may not lawfully preach if there were ſuch reſtrictions ſuperadded to the command of preaching, then it were ſtill eaſie for the Magiſtrate to put all from preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by writing ſuch and ſuch Reſtrictions; for it would take but a little more time to do it; for firſt he might ſend his command to preach, and his Inſtructions to a few; and they might not lawfully preach, becauſe they were but a few; and when they are laid by, he ſends his command to preach with Inſtructions to another ſmall number of them, and ſo on, till he had put all of them from preaching; for many ſmalls will amount to All be-time.</p>
               <p>In his 6th. he grants, <hi>That when that which the Magiſtrate commands by virtue of his Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, is not only lawful, but neceſſary by virtue of a Command of God; the prefixing of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy cannot alter the nature of the Duty.</hi> He might have added, That the affixing of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions can no more alter the nature of a
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:40126:165"/> Duty than the prefixing of the Supremacy can alter it; but he adds, <hi>That he hath above cleared, that what was done by the indulged Miniſters, was neither expedient nor lawful;</hi> but he hath never cleared it, but it hath been cleared, that what the indulged Miniſters did in preaching in the places to which they were indulged, was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, expedient, and in many reſpects neceſſary.</p>
               <p>In his 7th. he grants, <hi>If this ſuppoſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand came to Miniſters already preaching, the Supremacy might be ſufficiently delete by a Proteſtation or Declaration, that they preach by virtue of Chriſts Supremacy; but if it were given to cuted. Miniſters detained from their work till they ſhould thus acknowledge the unlawful Supremacy of the Magiſtrate, He ſuppoſes there might be ground here for a demur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I do not underſtand what this thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging means, or this <hi>thus</hi> relates to; I doubt if he could well explicate this; if he thinks that the preaching of theſe outed Miniſters would be an acknowledging of that unlawful Supremacy, why ſhould not the preaching of the already ſetled Miniſters be ſo too? Why might not a Declaration ſalve all in the Miniſters that were out, as well as in theſe who were in? If this were an acknowledging of the unlawful Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, I wonder why he ſhould be in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur. The Argument I perceive hath ſtrangely puzled him. If he be not poſitive, that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to which the unlawful Supremacy is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed, ſhould be refuſed, why is he ſo poſitive, that a command to preach ſhould be quite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:40126:166"/> becauſe of Inſtructions ſuperadded in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Act; I can ſee no ſhadow of Reaſon for this: now he is far from being Peremptour in the former caſe, but very, very modeſt; <hi>I ſuppoſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>there might be ground here for a demur;</hi> he does not poſitively aſſert, That they ſhould refuſe to preach in this caſe, but he only ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; not that there was actually, but that there might be ground; not for a refuſal, but only for a demur. I wiſh he had pondered his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in its full ſtrength; it's like it would have put him in a demur as to the writing of this Hiſtory, and ſpared him a great deal of need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs labour, and much waſte of his precious time, which might have been improven to the good of the Church and his own edification. I leave him in this demur, and come to the 7th. Objection, which he propoſeth in this queſtion. It ſeemeth then you would not be for Miniſters returning to their own charges, if the Magiſtrate ſhould grant ſuch an order or permiſſion; he who will not be for a Miniſters doing his duty, is wilful without and againſt Reaſon; but he who will not be for a Miniſters returning to his own Charge, will not be for a Miniſters doing his duty; and therefore he is wilful without and againſt Reaſon.</p>
               <p>In his firſt he grants, <hi>That though the Order or Permiſſion did expreſly mention the Supremacy, as it's ground, that yet it might be made uſe of with a Proteſtation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſee the Author in this caſe, would not ſcar at the Magiſtrates ordering; and why then
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:40126:166"/> makes he ſuch a buſineſs about the word <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That their returning to their own Charges, though the Magiſtrate order it, is not a renouncing of their former miſſion and old right, nor a renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of their dependence upon Chriſt, nor a deriving of their Miniſtry from the Magiſtrate; for if it were ſuch, the matter could not be ſalved by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation.</hi> This Conceſſion overturns a great part of his Book.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There was no mention made of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy at all in the Indulgence; and therefore there was no need by his own Conceſſion of ſuch a Proteſtation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Though there had been mention of it, Miniſters returning to their own Charges, would have been, according to this Conceſſion, but a ſeeming Homologation of the ſinful uſurpation.</p>
               <p>In his 2d. he thinks, if the permiſſion were not univerſal, but a permiſſion of ſome only, that then they ſhould not go; and why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Magiſtrates intention to divide, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt; ſuppoſe that to be true, yet the Miniſters returning to their own Charge, hath no tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to diviſion. If men muſt not do their duty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they who permit them to do it, have ill Deſigns, this would be a new device for tortur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mens Conſciences, and would make Miniſters as dependent upon the Magiſtrates intention, as to the lawfulneſs of their miniſterial actings, as the Papiſts are dependent upon the Prieſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, as to the validity of their Sacraments. If a Miniſter ſhould not go to his own Charge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:40126:167"/> the Magiſtrate hath an ill deſign in permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, by the ſame reaſon a Priſoner ſhould not go home to his Wife and Children, becauſe the Magiſtrate hath an ill deſign in letting him go home. He ſays, <hi>This is contrary to our Covenants;</hi> it's ſtrange how any man could imagine, that Miniſters going to their places and ſtations, could be contrary to the Covenant, which ſuppoſeth that every man ſhould keep him within the bounds of place, ſtation and vocation; ſuch wild conceits tend to render the Covenants ridiculous. He grants that the Miniſters permitted, would be freed from trouble, and the Congregations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome advantage; yet the publick good of the Church would be prejudged; but what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage could Congregations receive from them if that were true, that they were not the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt, but of men, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> He deſtroys what he had formerly builded; but he does well in caſting down what he had ſinfully build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The publick good of the Church is nor to be meaſured by any particular mans phanſie; and Miniſters muſt not leave their ſtations, or refuſe to go to them, becauſe this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon judges that the Church is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged by their ſo doing; and their returning to their own Charges, does no way tend to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Magiſtrate in uſurpations or encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but to confirm him in doing his duty, in ſetting Miniſters in their Charges, as <hi>Joſiah</hi> ſet the Prieſts in their Charges, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.2.</p>
               <p>In his 3d. he thinks, <hi>That the Miniſters ſhould not go to their own Charges, if they were confined,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:40126:167"/> though the liberty were granted to them all, becauſe of the ill deſign of the Magiſtrate; and many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies that would follow.</hi> We have ſpoken enough of the Magiſtrates intention. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences do no way urge the indulged Miniſters, who never promiſed to keep their confinement. Their returning to their proper Charges does not incapacitate them for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elſewhere; they may with hazard after their returning, preach elſewhere, if it be found ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary by thoſe to whom it is competent to determine matters of that nature. If his reaſons conclude, they will not only conclude, That outed Miniſters ſhould not return to their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; but that though they had not been outed, they ſhould have outed themſelves to preach in other Congregations where there was ſo great ignorance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If a corruption of a great part of the Land be a good reaſon for Miniſters not fixing, then how comes it, that the Apoſtles fixed Miniſters, when the whole World almoſt was corrupt with Paganiſm? and it's looſe work to looſe every one, and let them go and preach where they liſt.</p>
               <p>In his 4th. he ſays, <hi>Though this liberty were without confinement, yet if any one or other of thoſe Preſcriptions were added, with which the indulgence was clogged, that the liberty could not be accepted, for the reaſons againſt the indulgence would militate againſt that liberty.</hi> But may not rational men make uſe of a grant of due liberty, and yet not take on clogs? The Magiſtrates making clogs, does not clog them, except they take on
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:40126:168"/> the clogs; may not a man return to his own houſe to do the Duty of the Maſter of a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though the Magiſtrate preſcribe Injunctions to him, which he cannot in Conſcience obey? We have ſeen the vanity of his militating Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which fight againſt the wind, and conclude nothing againſt the indulged Miniſters.</p>
               <p>In his 5th. he ſays, <hi>That though the grant of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty were Univerſal, and without intanglements, and grounds of ſcrupling,</hi> that he leaves it to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Prudence to conſider, whether, as matters now ſtand, <hi>the Lord be not rather calling them to preach his Name on the mountains, ſeeing that way hath been ſo bleſſed, and Adverſaries are not really repenting, and that ſuch a Permiſſion could not flow from good, but ill Principles.</hi> I remember, I have anſwered to this before, and ſhewed the vanity of theſe Reaſons; and hence it appears, that his deſign is to put Miniſters and people in a State of Hoſtility with the Magiſtrate; he is not for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving from them, according to the dictates of the Author of the <hi>Cup of cold Water;</hi> but enough of this before. I hope no judicious perſon will imagine, that ſuch wild conceits, <hi>viz. That it's unlawful for Miniſters to ſettle in any particular Charge, when a great part of the Land is prejudged againſt the work of God, that the peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry granted by the lawful Magiſtrate, is to be refuſed, if the Magiſtrate be not a real Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and if he have not gracious Principles and good deſigns in granting that which he ought to grant;</hi> I ſay, I hope that no judicious perſon will imagine, that becauſe the Author is deſigned a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:40126:168"/> in the Title-page, that theſe and the like Conceits ſcattered through the Hiſtory, are the opinions of Presbyterians.</p>
               <p>The 8th. Objection may be thus proponed; The peaceable, ſafe exerciſe of the miniſtry gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Magiſtrate, is a mercy promiſed by the Lord, and of great import to Souls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore it ſhould not be rejected but accepted. What he anſwers, <hi>That the Goſpel may be preached, though the Magiſtrate grant not the peaceable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of preaching, as it was by Chriſt and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> is true; but it is nothing to the purpoſe: he ſhould have ſhewed, That Chriſt or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles refuſed the Magiſtrates Permiſſion to preach when it was granted. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting ſuch a grant, that he intreats for it, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.39. <hi>I beſeech thee ſuffer me to ſpeak unto the people.</hi> 2. He would make the world believe, That the outed Miniſters had left their Charges out of a Principle of reaſonleſs fear, and were like <hi>Solomons</hi> Sluggard, who imagines a Lyon to be there, where Lyons uſe not to be; Lyons uſe not to haunt Ways and Streets: but the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of thoſe Miniſters was not feigned; they did not fear where no fear was; he ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred how this Lyon frighted himſelf ſo far, that in his fear he engaged to put the broad Sea betwixt him and that Lyon. He ſays, <hi>The Goſpel might have been preached without this Indulgence, though with leſs eaſe, peace and quietneſs to the Preachers and Hearers; yet he is ſure with more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward quietneſs of mind, and acceptance with God, and with more ground of hope of a rich Bleſſing to
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:40126:169"/> follow their pains, as experience hath proven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Theſe are his own imaginations. 2. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath not proven that they who have rejected the peaceable exerciſe of their miniſtry, when they might have had it in a lawful way, have had more ſucceſs in preaching, or more inward peace in chuſing a way of preaching, that expoſed them to moleſtation, than they would have had, if they had embraced the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able exerciſe of their miniſtry. Indulged Miniſters could not have peace and quiet in their minds to reject the offer of the peaceable exerciſe of their miniſtry. And the aſſurance of this Author. That they would have had more quietneſs in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing than in chuſing the peaceable exerciſe of their miniſtry, is no evidence to the contrary this is no Demonſtration. The Author of the Hiſtory of the Indulgence was ſure, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Miniſters would have more peace and ſucceſs in refuſing, than in embracing the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able exerciſe of their miniſtry; and therefore they ſhould have refuſed it; the indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters muſt have better ſurety for the conſequence than his aſſurance.</p>

The indulged Miniſters were lawfully ſetled in their reſpective Charges, as hath been often cleared.</p>
               <p>He hath vitiate the 11th. Argument by foiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it one of his own Imagination, That the relaxation of the Reſtraint formerly laid on, was ſinful upon the Granters part, which is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious falſhood; for it was the Magiſtrates Duty to grant ſuch a Relaxation. After ſeveral Diſcourſes which are not to the purpoſe, he grants in his 5th. Anſwer, <hi>That after an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal overthrow of the Priviledges of the Church; we may lawfully accept of little, when more can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had;</hi> and ſo he yields the Cauſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does what he hath been formerly doing. What he adds, That that little muſt be ſuch as was not unlawful at any time to be accepted of; and that we muſt accept it in another manner than could ever have been accounted a ſinful compliance, is no evaſion for him; for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation was lawful in its ſelf; and the manner of acceptance was no ſinful compliance, and could never truly be accounted ſinful.</p>
               <p>To his 6th. I anſwer, That the peaceable li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of publick preaching cannot be had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Magiſtrate; and until he prove, that the peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry is a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thing, and the Relaxation or the Grant of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="348" facs="tcp:40126:170"/> Relaxation to be a needleſs compliance with, or a Confirmation of any Uſurpation.</p>
               <p>In the 12. Objection he hath foiſted in one of his own ſuppoſitions, <hi>That the Relaxation</hi> (ſo often mentioned before) <hi>was an inſufferable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,</hi> which is manifeſtly falſe; If there was any defect in the Miniſters when they were at firſt turned out, the Author of this Hiſtory was as defective as his Neighbours. By reſiſting unto blood, I ſuppoſe he does not mean, that Miniſters ſhould have continued preaching in their own Pulpits, till they had been killed in them; our Saviour allows Miniſters, when they are perſecuted in one City, to flee to another; he did not himſef continue preaching at <hi>Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> after he was commanded by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to remove, till his Blood was ſhed. The indulged Miniſters accepting of a part of what was formerly taken from them, is not a parting with a hoof, nor doth it put them in any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity to uſe any lawful means in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſtations for recovering former priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
               <p>He ſuppoſes in the 13th. Objection, That the Magiſtrates principal Deſign in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was the eſtabliſhment of his own Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy; but how can that be proven, That the Magiſtrate in granting the ſafety of the exerciſe of the Miniſtry, did intend the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of any ſinful Supremacy? this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proven from the Magiſtrates Act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation; for this was an Act of that Authority which is of God, an Act of lawful Civil power;
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:40126:170"/> if this Act have no tendency to ſuch an intent, how can he conclude, that this was confeſſed by the Magiſtrates Deſign? for the Magiſtrate hath not by deed or word confeſſed it; but the Author, like ſome others, concludes many things by gueſſing; they lay Foundations by gueſs, and build up conjectural Superſtructures up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe conjectural Foundations. But ſuppoſe the Magiſtrate had ſuch a Deſign, this could no way vitiate the practice of the indulged Miniſters, as hath been frequently manifeſted.</p>
               <p>The 14th. Argument may be propoſed thus; When the Magiſtrate grants to Miniſters the peaceable exerciſe of the miniſtry in one Act, and in another Act, by way of command, and not by way of paction, ſuperads Inſtructions, which thoſe Miniſters cannot obſerve; if theſe Miniſters accept of the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry, and not only obſerve not the Inſtructions, but alſo declare to the Magiſtrate, That they cannot receive ſuch Inſtructions; theſe Miniſters do their duty in chuſing what is good, and refuſing what is evil; but the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſters did ſo, and therefore they did what was their Duty.</p>
               <p>He anſwers, 1. <hi>That though the Magiſtrate thought it below them to act any otherways than by way of command; yet the nature of the thing ſaith, That the accepting of the firſt, doth vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually engage to the ſecond; both making up one complex grant, or one Indulgence ſo qualified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I reply, 1. That he knew by experience, that the Magiſtrate can come ſo low, as to require
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:40126:171"/> conſent by Subſcription; but the Magiſtrate did not require of the indulged Miniſters to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe either by word or writ to obſerve theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I perceive when the Author knows not what to anſwer, he alledges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the nature of the thing ſays what he would ſay; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the nature of this thing, nor the nature of any other thing ſays, That the accepting of good, doth virtually engage to the accepting of evil; nor doth Nature ſay, That the Act of Inſtructions was an Act of Indulgence; it being a gravaminous Act; now an Act impoſing things that are grievous, is not an Act of Indulgence, nor doth nature ſay, that theſe two Acts are one Act; for though they were made by the ſame Magiſtrate, for the ſame Miniſters; yet they were different Acts, and as diſtinct in their natures, as good and evil are; and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters did wiſely diſtinguiſh them one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, in accepting the one, and giving Reaſons why they could not receive the other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſays, <hi>Though the Council did not call for any formal or expreſs engagements from them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the performance of theſe Injunctions, yet their carriage to Mr.</hi> Blair <hi>upon his renouncing of theſe Injunctions, ſheweth, that they meant thoſe Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for Conditions; this alſo they declared in their after-Proclamations.</hi> I anſwer, If the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, as he grants, were not at firſt given as Conditions by way of paction, ſeeing the Council did not call for any engagement from the Miniſters to the performance of theſe
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:40126:171"/> Injunctions, no After-acts of the Council could turn what the Council had long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore acted by way of command, into a pacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal tranſactation; if the After-act of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Society could turn their own Commands, or Directions given to others, into Pactions, without the conſent of thoſe to whom ſuch Commands or Directions were given, it would make a ſtrange reel in the World, and men ſhould thus be involved by Paction to perform Conditions, though they never conſented, yea, though they declared they did not, nor could not conſent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Although the Council had ſhewed by their impriſoning of Mr. <hi>Blair,</hi> that they meant thoſe Injunctions for Conditions, that being ſo long after the Indulgence, it could no way conſtitute the nature of the Indulgence, which had its being and exiſtence long before.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The meaning of one Party, though ſhewed, will not make a Paction, except the other party conſent.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Author grants, That Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſpoke the ſame upon the matter that Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> did; and ſo did ſeveral others who were before the Council at that time; and the Magiſtrate, as I am readily informed, ſaid, That it was ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of what was done by Mr. <hi>Blair,</hi> that occaſioned his impriſonment.</p>
               <p>But 5ly. Suppoſe he had been only impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned upon that account, becauſe he would not receive thoſe Injunctions; that will not prove, that the Magiſtrate did mean them for
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:40126:172"/> Conditions; for the Magiſtrate often impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneth men for diſobeying Acts of Council, though the perſons impriſoned have made no promiſe to obey thoſe Acts; and though the Injunctions which they obey not, were never meant by the Council for Conditions.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Suppoſe the Magiſtrate had in the very Acts of Indulgence, ſignified that they had meant thoſe Injunctions for Conditions; and had put in thoſe Injunctions as Conditions in the Acts of Indulgence. I do not ſee how this would have rendred their miniſterial actings in the Pariſhes to which they were indulged unlawful, nor rendred thoſe Miniſters any ways guilty, providing that they had no ways conſented unto thoſe Injunctions. Suppoſe <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had granted liberty to the Midwives to do their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the travelling <hi>Hebrew Women,</hi> upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that they ſhould kill the Male-Children; this ſhould not have barred the Midwives from that work of mercy towards the <hi>Hebrew-Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> in Child-birth; and if the Midwives had no way conſented to this Condition, they would have no ways been guilty of any ſin; though neceſſary Duties be clogged with ſinful Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions impoſed by men, they ſhould not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; but the Duties ſhould be done, and the ſinful Injunctions diſobeyed. And ſuppoſe the Midwives knew that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would have reſtrained them from doing that Labour of Love, that work of neceſſity and mercy to the Labouring Women; if they had foretold, that they would not kill the Male-Children, I think
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:40126:172"/> they did better to hold their Tongue, than to put themſelves out of a capacity to do ſo needful a Duty to the Travailing-Women; but there is no need of this for vindicating the practice of the indulged Miniſters, becauſe they declared to the Magiſtrate, That <hi>they had received full Preſcriptions from Chriſt, which they behoved to obſerve; and that they could not receive ſuch Preſcriptions as the Magiſtrate gave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What he ſays in his 3d. about accepting a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with a burden; and the ſimilitude of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther granting a Portion of Land, and enjoying the payment of Debts, is before anſwered. The impertinency of that Similitude is very palpable; if a Father ſhould command his Son to worſhip God in ſecret Prayer, and withal give him ſome ſuperſtitious Directions; the Son were not to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſecret Prayer, becauſe of thoſe ſupeardded ſuperſtitious Injunctions. But it's time for me to weary of Repetitions.</p>
               <p>In Object. 15. he ſuppoſes, <hi>That the acceptance of the favour, had need of a Purgation by a Proteſtation; but the granting of the ſafe and peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry, ought not to have been proteſted againſt.</hi> The many accounts upon which he ſays <hi>the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Indulgence was ſo foul, that no Proteſtation could have ſalved the matter;</hi> we have found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on examination to come to no account.</p>
               <p>To the 16. Object. which rationally concludes. <hi>That the Magiſtrates allowance being directed to none but to Miniſters antecedently ordained, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a juſt ground of Scruple.</hi> He anſwers, <hi>That this allowance being more than a Permiſſion, did flow
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:40126:173"/> from the Supremacy, and import the deriving of a Power to exerciſe the Function in ſuch a place from the Magiſtrate.</hi> I reply, the allowing of Miniſters to preach the Goſpel, is the Magiſtrates Duty, and flows from no other Supremacy, than that which every Magiſtrate hath, as ſupream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in his own Dominions. If Magiſtrates ſhould maintain, defend, protect Miniſters in the exerciſe of their miniſtry, they ſhould allow them to preach; otherways they ſhould be obliged to maintain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what they do not allow. He grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, <hi>That the Magiſtrate may command Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to preach the Goſpel, and command im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports allowance, and ſomething more; and where there is no ſetled Judicatories in the Kirk, which outed Miniſters own, to ſettle Miniſters in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Charges, if the Magiſtrate may not in that caſe ſettle Miniſters in particular Charges, but only command them to preach where they pleaſe, ſome places where there were moſt need of preaching, might be left utterly deſtitute, and the Magiſtrate could do nothing to remedy that evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We heard that the ſecond Book of Diſcipline is for the Magiſtrates placing Miniſters in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and therefore to offend at the word <hi>Allowance,</hi> is not the kindly work of a well-informed, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſcience; but an effect of Ignorance Altho' we ſhould be diſpleaſed at ſin, yet we ſhould never offend or ſtumble (for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending properly imports ſtumbling) at ſin much leſs at what is lawful: all ſtumbling is ſin, and flows from ſin, and not from due Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</p>
               <pb n="353" facs="tcp:40126:173"/>
               <p>His anſwers to the 17 Obj. are his own falſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations; for what the indulged Miniſters did, was no virtual invalidating of their prior Ordination: Nor 2. did it ſay, That as to the Miniſtry, they depend upon any power in the Magiſtrate, as the fountain of their Miniſtry: It's true, the peaceable and ſafe exerciſe of their Miniſtry is from the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate under God, who hath appointed Magiſtrates to be the ſhields of the earth, and nurſing fathers to his Church. Nor is the acceptance of this favour a ſubjection unto any incroachment. Nor is this the Queſtion, whether the reſtraints, formerly laid on, were vincible or not, but whether the relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe reſtraints was to be accepted or rejected. He cannot but acknowledge, that the Magiſtrates enjoyning and warranting, as he words it, includes a permiſſion to Preach, and is a real relaxation of former reſtraints, and in ſo far might be made uſe of; but if the Author would have dealt fairly, he ſhould have retained the words, which the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate made uſe of in the Acts of Indulgence, and not foiſted in his own words. The refuſal of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation, when the Magiſtrate offered it, would have been an offence and ſcandal to many perſons; and it would have been ſo far from defeating <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianiſm,</hi> that it could onely have evidenced the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſers to be ignorant of the <hi>Eraſtian</hi> Controverſie, and bred this falſe conceit, that the Magiſtrates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing of Civil reſtraints, which hindred the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able exerciſe of the Miniſtry; or that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates granting the peaceable exerciſe of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, by permitting and allowing Miniſters to Preach and exerciſe the other parts of their Miniſtry,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:40126:174"/> is the exerciſe of <hi>Eraſtianiſm.</hi> The right way which the indulged Miniſters took, was to accept of what was good, and to refuſe what was evil, and to give Reaſons for their refuſal.</p>
               <p>Neither did they virtually acknowledge any of the Magiſtrates wrongs, as he alledges in his 4 where he adds, that their plain Declaration to purge themſelves, will be but a contradiction and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of their own deed, becauſe the impoſer can onely put a ſenſe and gloſs upon his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, and the granter of a warrant and favour, on the ſame; and in his ſenſe, it is, at leaſt, virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally accepted, by all who accept of it, if plain deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be owned; and I ſuppoſe Miniſters when deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Council, ſhould not walk upon falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or on mental reſerves, or on what is equivalent. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Indulged Miniſters declared plainly to the Council what they did accept, and what they could not receive, as we heard before; but he thinks, that if they accepted of the favour, they could not by the plaineſt Declaration purge themſelves from acknowledging the Magiſtrates wrongs; that's a hard caſe, that men cannot accept of what is good and right from the Magiſtrate, but they muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily acknowledge the Magiſtrates wrongs: That's ſtrange, that they cannot diſtinguiſh and ſeparate good from ill, and right from wrong; and that their purging themſelves from acknowledging what is wrong, is a contradiction to and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own deed, whereby they accepted of what was good. It ſeems the Author hath had ſome new-found Laws of contradiction, for by the old rules by which contradictions were wont to be judged,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:40126:174"/> there will be no appearance of a contradiction found here. Was the Magiſtrates wrongs the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters deed? But he will prove what he hath ſaid; let us hear how he will convince theſe Miniſters, that they have contradicted and condemned themſelves. Becauſe, ſays he, the impoſer can onely put a ſenſe and gloſs upon his own inſtructions, and the granter of a warrant and favour on the ſame: And in his ſenſe it is at leaſt virtually accepted by all who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it. And therefore the Miniſters who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the favour of the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry, did condemn this acceptance, by their plain Declaring, that they could not receive the inſtructions. <hi>Anſw.</hi> A goodly Demonſtration, onely it hath two faults; that it hath neither Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor the appearance of Reaſon in it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves no other anſwer but laughter. 1. If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions impoſed be ambiguous, and are as capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of one ſenſe as of another, then the impoſer can beſt ſhew what is the ſenſe, which is his ſenſe, and they on whom ſuch injunctions are impoſed, ſhould deſire the impoſer to declare his meaning, that they may be clear. If he do not explain his ſenſe, then if the words be capable of a good ſenſe, and of an ill, they ſhould deal ſo candidly as to ſhew the impoſer that they cannot keep ſuch an injunction in the ill ſenſe which it is capable of, but if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions be given in words which are not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ambiguous, but are clear, according to the common and generally received acceptation of them, then the impoſer cannot in reaſon find fault, if theſe injunctions be obſerved according to the common received ſenſe of the words; neither can he put any
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:40126:175"/> ſenſe he pleaſes upon words, which by common uſe have a determinate ſenſe, for this would breed nothing but confuſion; for if the ſenſe of plain words in an injunction did depend not upon the common ſenſe of all men, who uſe ſuch words, but upon the meer will of the impoſer, then by the word, light, he might mean darkneſs; and by the word, good, he might mean evil; and by the word, Eaſt, he might mean Weſt; and by true Holineſs, he might mean Superſtition and Idolatry: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this aſſertion of the Author, that the impoſer can onely put a ſenſe and gloſs upon his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, muſt be taken with a grain of ſalt. 2. This aſſertion is nothing to the purpoſe in hand, for the ſenſe of the Magiſtrates injunctions in the act of inſtructions, was clear enough: If the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters had received them in one ſenſe, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate had given them in another, there had been ſome reaſon for this Diſcourſe about the ſenſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions; but there was no Queſtion betwixt the Magiſtrate and Miniſters about the ſenſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions; the Miniſters were clear enough, as to the Magiſtrates meaning, but they declared, they could receive no ſuch Eccleſiaſtical inſtructions from the Magiſtrate, and that they had full preſcriptions from Chriſt to regulate them in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry, and that they behoved in the diſcharge thereof, to be accountable to him. Now ſeeing they did not receive the injunctions at all, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them in no ſenſe, and therefore his Diſcourſe about the ſenſe of injunctions, is to little ſenſe, and to no purpoſe in this place. 3. As to the favour of the ſafe exerciſe of their Miniſtry in the paroches,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:40126:175"/> to which they were indulged; the ſenſe of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate was clearly enough known by the Acts of Indulgence, which did ſhew, that notwithſtanding of reſtraints formerly laid upon them, they might now have the peaceable ſafe exerciſe of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, in theſe paroches. And Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon</hi> in his Speech to the Council, in name of his Brethren, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the favour of the free liberty of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick exerciſe of their Miniſtry, after ſo long a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, and of the Protection of Lawful Authority. This was very plain dealing with the Council, and was not a walking upon fallacies or mental reſerves, nor on what was equivalent to theſe, as this Author falſly alledges. If any be pleaſed to imagine, that the Magiſtrate had ſome ſenſe lurking in his own mind, which was not expreſſed in the Acts of Indulgence, the Indulged Miniſters are not account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for ſuch imaginary ſenſes. What they accepted was plainly imported in the Acts of Indulgence; and they plainly declared, what it was that they did accept. So that this Authors reaſoning, that becauſe the impoſer can onely put a ſenſe upon his own injunctions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore the Indulged Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in declaring they did not acknowledge any of the wrongs of the Magiſtrate, did contradict and condemn their own deed, is a becauſe that hath no cauſe in it, a fallacy, <hi>a non cauſa, pro cauſa;</hi> or rather it hath not ſo much colour as to deſerve the name of a fallacy; and it will deceive none who have any skill of Reaſoning, except it be ſuch as have a mind to be deceived.</p>
               <p>To the 18. and laſt Objection, which ſays, <hi>That the acceptance of the Indulgence, imports no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:40126:176"/> of the Miniſtry to mens arbitrary diſpoſal, but onely a ſubjecting of the perſons of Miniſters to the Magiſtrate.</hi> He Anſwers, That the Act of Indulgence did not onely mention Miniſters repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch or ſuch places, but ſpoke likewiſe of the exerciſe of their Miniſtry, which it allowed them. I Reply: This is an ill Argument; the Act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence ſpoke of the exerciſe of the Miniſtry, and allowed the exerciſe of it, and therefore the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Indulgence was a ſubjecting of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry to mens arbitrary diſpoſal. If the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates allowing of the exerciſe of the Miniſtry, doth ſubject the Miniſtry to the will and arbitrary diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of men, then the Magiſtrates allowing of the exerciſe of the Miniſtry muſt be an ill thing, no way deſirable; and ſo the Magiſtrate would be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged not to allow of the exerciſe of the Miniſtry; theſe are pitiful abſurdities. What he adds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the preſcribing of ſeveral Rules, is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, for the Act of Inſtructions was not the Act of Indulgence, and it was not accepted by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Miniſters: But he will prove that their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry was ſubject to the arbitrary diſpoſal of men, becauſe they were made liable to puniſhment, for not obſerving the Rules and Injunctions preſcribed. If this Argument were good, it would prove all the Non Conformiſts in <hi>Scotland</hi> to be Conformiſts, and ſubject to Prelacy, becauſe they are all liable to puniſhment by the Law, for not obſerving the Laws requiring Conformity to Prelacy: But theſe things are not worthy to be repeated. In his 2. he ſays, Theſe Sufferings indeed declared a ſubjection of their Perſons, but their ſilence ſhall be found, I
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:40126:176"/> fear, to have done more, and their former ſin can be no ground to juſtifie their preſent practice, in accepting of this Indulgence, which inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a relaxation, is a further wreathing of the yoke about our necks. I Anſwer, He had done better to have expreſſed his fears concerning his own ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, than to have expreſſed his fears of the ſilence of the outed Miniſters of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> they might preach as they had acceſs, though he did not know of it, it became him to be very ſparing in cenſuring others for ſilence, who by his own ſubſcription obliged himſelf not to be, and ſo not to preach in <hi>Britain</hi> or <hi>Ireland.</hi> I have ſeen this deed of his loaded with a great many Abſurdities, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated from this, that he was in no hazard of his life, or of any great ſuffering: But having heard from one intimately acquainted with him, that the man was naturally timorous, though he were alive, I would pity him, but being dead, I ſhall not ſo much as repeat the Abſurdities, with which, this deed of his is loaded: Onely it needs not ſeem very ſtrange if he who was ſo far tranſported with the paſſion of fear, when there was no great hazard, as to quit the exerciſe of his Miniſtry in theſe three Nations, hath been ſo far tranſported by other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as to inveigh againſt the Lawful exerciſe of the Miniſtry, of theſe who could not in Conſcience neglect the opportunity of the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry, when the Lord in his good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence inclined the heart of the Magiſtrate to grant it. That which they accepted was no yoke of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, but a very deſirable Liberty, the Liberty of
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:40126:177"/> the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry, under the Protection of Lawful Authority.</p>
               <p>Having anſwered the Authors Reaſons againſt the Indulgence, as it was accepted, and refuted his Anſwers to the Objections, which in his conceit contained all that could be ſaid in defence of that acceptance. I refer the refutation of the falſhoods, which are in the Hiſtorical part of this Hiſtory, to thoſe who are better acquainted with the matters of Fact than I am. It were fit that the Brethren who find themſelves wronged by this Hiſtorian, ſhould truly repreſent matters of Fact, relating to them which are miſrepreſented by this Hiſtorian; that both the unreaſonableneſs of his Reaſons, and the falſhood of his ſtories might be known to all.</p>
               <p>I ſhall onely ſay ſomewhat for the Vindication of theſe of the Indulged Miniſters, who appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Council in <hi>July,</hi> 1673. that the Honeſty and Faithfulneſs of thoſe Miniſters, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs of the ſlanders of this Hiſtorian may appear. I ſhall the rather take ſome notice of this part of his ſtory, becauſe as it takes up a great part of his Book, from Page 58 to 85, ſo the Author hath here done all he could to render thoſe Miniſters contemptible. And I have now before me, not onely the Narrative, a part whereof this Author hath inſert in his Book, which was written by one, as I am informed, who was not preſent, but alſo a Narrative written by one who was preſent, who hath written a full anſwer to this Hiſtory of the Indulgence, which, if it come to the hands of the Author of the Epiſtle prefixed to this Hiſtory, it will, I hope, convince him that he was far out in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſticks,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:40126:177"/> when he ſaid, that the Reaſon of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory would never be anſwered but by clamour, for in it he may ſee his own and the Hiſtorians un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable clamours ſolidly refuted by ſound Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. In this Anſwer, the Reverend Author, who was one of thoſe Miniſters, who were cited before the Council, for not keeping the 29th. of <hi>May,</hi> hath ſet down the matter of Fact, and refuted the quibblings of the Author of the Hiſtory. I refer the Reader for full ſatisfaction to the Authors An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and ſhall onely make uſe of ſo much of his paper as may ſufficiently clear thoſe Miniſters, and Evidence that they refuſed Obedience to thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and gave a ſufficient teſtimony againſt them. Thoſe Miniſters were interrogate by the Council, whether or not they had Preached upon the 29th. of <hi>May?</hi> Two or three of them who had Preached that day, upon the account that it was their ordinary Lecture-day, replyed that they had Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; whereupon they were commanded forth: All the reſt anſwered, that they had not Preached; and being interrogate wherefore they did not Preach? They Replyed (as they had before agreed) that they were not free to obſerve any Anniverſary day of Humane inſtitution for Religious Worſhip, and that becauſe they ſaw no ground for it in the Word of God; beſides which they could not act in the matters of Gods ſolemn Worſhip. Whereupon they were fined by the Council in the half of a years ſtipend, which Act was intimated to them the <hi>Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> following. 1. Hence it appears that there was no ground to alledge, that thoſe two or three who Preached, did obſerve the 29th. of <hi>May:</hi> And
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:40126:178"/> it had been a reaſonleſs and ridiculous thing to have forborn to preach upon their ordinary Lecture-day becauſe it was the 29th. of <hi>May.</hi> 2. Nor any ground for quarrelling at the Indulged Miniſters, for not ſpeaking againſt the Narrative of an Act of Parliament, that was neither in their Summons, nor yet in their Sentence, and which was really made void by that Act made in the foregoing <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> which was put in the place of that Act, which was in Seſſ. 2. of Parliament 1. 1662.</p>
               <p>The Brethren being removed, ſome of them were called in together upon particular Summons, for Baptizing of Children in other Congregations: and that defence, which the Informer ſpeaks of, that the inſtructions had not been intimate, did, as the anſwerer of the Hiſtory of the Indulgence inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, drop unwarily from the mouth of one. He ſays further that there were other Indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters there, who had never ſeen a double of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and hence very rationally infers, that they could not be the condition upon which they received the Liberty to exerciſe their Miniſtry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out moleſtation. If the Council had deſigned them for Conditions, they would have ſent them as ſoon as the Indulgence, and would have made ſurer work in their intimation. And whatever was their Deſign in giving theſe Inſtructions, they cannot be with any Reaſon or Senſe ſuppoſed to be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition upon which the Miniſters accepted the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, ſeeing it was accepted by them ere they ſaw the Inſtructions, and many of them had not ſeen the Inſtructions for ſome years after they had exerciſed their Miniſtry in theſe Pariſhes to which they were
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:40126:178"/> Indulged. He ſhews alſo that the inferences which the Hiſtorian draws from that defence, <hi>viz.</hi> That it contained a tacite acknowledgment, that they would not have done what they did, if the Act had been intimate to them, and that in time coming, they would willingly obey them, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the injunctions were juſt and righteous, and ſuch as neither they, nor any other, ſhould, diſobey, whether becauſe of the matter, or becauſe, of the power enjoyning them, are without all Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and will not follow from that Antecedent, by thrice nineteen. Seeing this onely follows, that therefore they ought to be free of all damage inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, becauſe of that Fact. And further, he ſhews, that the Anſwer which the Hiſtorian ſuggeſts, <hi>viz.</hi> That they might not be anſwerable to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, to refuſe to Baptize any Child within the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, brought to them for that end, is a lax tale; for 1. (ſays he) it will be hard for him to make out ſuch an Obligation. 2. The Order of the Church determines the contrary. 3. They muſt have it teſtified that they are within the Covenant. 4. That the Parents, at leaſt the preſenters, are not ſcandalous. 5. And that they are not groſly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, or if the teſtimony be not from one who takes inſpection of their knowledge, they muſt examine them in the grounds of Religion. He adds after all this; there was a Macer ſent to the utter Council Houſe, who ſummoned the whole number of theſe Miniſters, to compear before the Council on <hi>Tueſday</hi> next.</p>
               <p>He adds, that in the interval betwixt that <hi>Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> and the <hi>Tueſday</hi> in the enſuing week, they
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:40126:179"/> met frequently every week-day, and twice upon the <hi>Tueſday:</hi> And partly from memory, and partly from draughts of papers, which he had by him, he ſhews, that at their very firſt meeting, one of their number told them, that he heard a whiſper, that ſubſcribed doubles of the Inſtructions would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to them at their next compearance. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they thought fit, that there ſhould be a draught of a paper, bearing in it a Teſtimony, not onely againſt the matter of the injunctions, but alſo, and mainly againſt the undue power of Eccleſiaſtick Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, aſſumed by the Magiſtrate, from upon ſome of them at leaſt (as was generally apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) had both their formation and injunction, and not only againſt it, as productive of theſe, but alſo of all other things of that Nature ſince the year 1660. Afterwards there was a draught produced, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in its Narrative a thankful acknowledgment of the taking off Reſtraints, and for granting the ſafe outward Liberty of the exerciſe of the Miniſtry, as alſo, a ſad complaint of what was grievous in the three Acts of Council, <hi>Sep.</hi> 3. 1672. complexly taken. Next there was a full and clear Aſſertion and Declaration of what was due to the Magiſtrate about Eccleſiaſtick Affairs, and what was not due to him in Eccleſiaſtick matters, in a ſtrict conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy unto the Judgment and Expreſſions of the greateſt of the <hi>Anti-eraſtian</hi> Divines. Then there was a repreſentation of Grievances, in ſeven full Paragraphs, more particularly of all contained in the foreſaid three Acts, and moſt particularly of thoſe contained in the Act of Injunctions; all which carry in their boſom a teſtimony againſt the ſinfulneſs and
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:40126:179"/> Uſurpation manifeſted in theſe matters of Grievance. And laſtly, There was a full Petition for Redreſs. This Paper was lookt upon, as too large, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ſhorter draught was fallen upon, not differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as to Method, nor yet as to Matter and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but onely contracted in fewer words; a double whereof (ſaith the Anſwerer of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory) I have in my hand; and I remember it was much debated, as to the alteration, detracting and adding of words and clauſes; but what thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Debates were, I cannot ſo diſtinctly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, onely one thing I do diſtinctly remember, that the principal Debate was about the adding of a Clauſe unto the cloſe of a Paragraph about the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions or Inſtructions for the further clearing of it, the Clauſe was conceived in theſe words, <hi>That we cannot receive from the Magiſtrate any Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Regulating us in the exerciſe of our Miniſtry.</hi> How this Debate came to a cloſe, the Informer does truly relate; for it being overtured, that inſtead of the former Clauſe, this ſhould be inſert, <hi>viz. We cannot receive from the Magiſtrate Inſtructions for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally and intrinſecally Eccleſiaſtical, for regulating us in the exerciſe of our Miniſtry.</hi> All did acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce.</p>
               <p>This Paper being compleat upon Tueſday be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore twelve hours it was appointed to be drawn in fair writ, that after Dinner it might be Subſcribed before their Appearance before the Council. But at that time, on a ſudden the turning of it into a Directory (as the Informer ſays) and the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one in their name to declare the ſubſtance of it before the Council, was generally conſented unto
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:40126:180"/> by Indulged and not Indulged. In voting who ſhould be their mouth, the whole votes ran upon Mr. <hi>George Hutcheſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Alexander Blair,</hi> and each of them voted to other, and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> had the greater number by very few. Upon their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance before the Council, the Clerk of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil did read in their hearing an Act, wherein each of them were fined in the half of a years ſtipend; after the reading whereof, Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon,</hi> addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Speech to my Lord Chancellour, after he had ſpoken ſomewhat relative to the Act of Fining, added, <hi>That their Lordſhips would be pleaſed, not to burden them with Impoſitions in the matter of their Miniſtry, wherein they were the Servants of Chriſt, and they being men who demeaned themſelves as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Loyal Subjects:</hi> The Miniſters thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves diſmiſſed, turned towards the door, my L. Chancellour required them to ſtay, and did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the Clerk to deliver to each of them a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Copy of that Act of Injunctions of <hi>Sep.</hi> 3. 1672. A good number of thoſe who were firſt in the Roll, and to whom theſe Inſtructions had not been ſent before, did take theſe papers in their hands, looking and expecting that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſhould have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the things agreed upon amongſt them former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but he having ſpoken ſomewhat already, thought he was not called to ſpeak till the Paper came to his own hand: When the Officer came to Mr. <hi>A. B.</hi> he taking the paper in his hand, among other things, had theſe words, or to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he could not receive Inſtructions from them for regulating him in the exerciſe of his Miniſtry, for if he did ſo, he ſhould not be Chriſts Ambaſſadour,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:40126:180"/> but theirs:</hi> Whereupon he was by the Chancellour committed to a Macer. Upon Mr. <hi>A. Blairs</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment to the Macer, one Miniſter, to wit, of thoſe who were in the Roll before him, ſaid to my my L. Chancellour, <hi>He believed that the reſt of the Miniſters of that Company, were of Mr.</hi> Blairs <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereof himſelf was one.</hi> And another ſaid, <hi>That one of theſe Rules did bring Miniſters in direct ſubordination to Prelacy, contrary to their Principles.</hi> Let me add; and one ſaid, <hi>That one of theſe Rules was impracticable;</hi> and all of them ſpoke more fully in theſe purpoſes than is here expreſſed.</p>
               <p>The very next Perſon in the Roll to Mr. <hi>Blair,</hi> and ſo ranked in the Printed Act containing the Fining, when upon the back of that confuſion, the paper was offered to him, did to my certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, though this be omitted by the Informer, turn towards my Lord Chancellour, and with an audible voice ſaid, <hi>My Lord, I adhere to that which Mr.</hi> Blair <hi>hath ſpoken;</hi> in ſpeaking of which words, my L. Chancellour did ſtare him in the face, but yet did not commit him to the Macer, and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſeeing he ſpoke theſe words with much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of ſpirit, and without the leaſt appearance of diſtempering Paſſion; with a ſutable Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Gravity, and alſo with a ſutable Reſpect unto Lawful Authority, both in expreſſion and geſture. Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon</hi> ſtepping in to take off Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and to remove any prejudice, that he apprehended the Council might have at him, he 1. humbly deſired their Lordſhips not to miſunderſtand his Brother, Mr. <hi>Alexander Blair;</hi> for as for Rules intrinſecally Eccleſiaſtick for regulating Miniſters in the exerciſe
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:40126:181" rendition="simple:additions"/> of their Miniſtry, he hoped their Lordſhips in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not to make or impoſe any ſuch upon them, who were the ſervants of Chriſt in theſe matters. He uſes juſt the words that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> made uſe of, onely with the addition of <hi>intrinſecally Eccleſiaſtick,</hi> (a term both intelligible, and that ought to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by all who meddle in theſe matters) for clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them as was agreed upon in the paper; and ſo not onely homologates what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had ſpoke, but alſo, though in modeſt terms, requeſts for the retracting of theſe Rules, refuſes Obedience to them, and gives a Reaſon wherefore Miniſters could not yield Obedience unto them; and albeit, as the Informer ſays, he was diſſatisfied with ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſpeaking, and with the defective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of what was ſpoken, yet, with the matter of it, he was never diſſatisfied: Here then is a clear and plain teſtimony given by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> in his own name, and in the name of his Brethren, not onely againſt the matter of theſe Rules, but alſo againſt the Power impoſing them in ſo far as undue. 2. In the other part of his Speech, which was in theſe words: <hi>But as for the Magiſtrates Power objective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Eccleſiaſtick, whereby they might judge of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, in order to their own Act, whether they would approve or diſcountenance ſuch a way, he knew no Reformed Divine that did deny it unto them; and did humbly deſire again, that their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips would not miſtake his Brother.</hi> He added this part of the Speech to the former, becauſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the Council did think that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not this piece of Power to the Magiſtrate, and that therefore the Chancellour was incenſed; and
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:40126:181" rendition="simple:additions"/> to rectifie this miſtake, he did ſhew that this was the judgment of all Reformed Divines, and ſo the judgment of his Brother, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> whom he account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be one of theſe Reformed Divines; and he had good ground to be aſſured of his aſſent to what he ſpoke, becauſe what was due, and what was not due to the Magiſtrate in, or about Eccleſiaſtick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, was condeſcended upon in that paper, agreed upon among themſelves in private. After Mr. <hi>H.</hi> had ſpoken this, another Miniſter ſaid, <hi>He could not receive Eccleſiaſtick Canons from their Lordſhips, but, as for Civil ſignifications of their pleaſure, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hazard of Civil Penalties, he could ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to that:</hi> And then another Miniſter did ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologate what he had ſpoken.</p>
               <p>In the cloſe of all, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> in the name of all, ſpoke as was formerly agreed upon; and in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of his Speech did ſhew, that a formal Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick Power could not be allowed to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, though a Power objectively Eccleſiaſtick was allowed to him, and did ſo clearly ſignifie, that they could not obey theſe Injunctions, that my Lord Chancellour anſwered him in theſe words, and no other, <hi>Then, Sir, we will puniſh you:</hi> Unto which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> did not reply in words, but only by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture. Although this Hiſtorian ſets himſelf always to repreſent Mr. <hi>B.</hi> as ſeparated from his Brethren, and acting in a divided way from them, yet he was ever one with them as to Judgment, Affection, and Action, though to their very great grief he was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from them, as to his ſuffering. 1. He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with them in one and the ſame paper to be preſented to the Council. 2. He conſented wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:40126:182"/> others to turn it into a Directory, and to chooſe one who in the name of the reſt ſhould ſpeak the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it before the Council. 3. He had many votes, almoſt the half, to ſpeak the mind of the reſt. 4. What he ſpoke was in the paper, and ſome did adhere formally, and all did cordially and really adhere upon the matter to what was ſpoken by him. 5. And what was ſpoken by others to that purpoſe, did agree with what he ſpoke, as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſenſe, and meaning. 6. After that Mr. <hi>Hutche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> had ſpoken to take him off, he was offering to ſay, that he meant the ſame things which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> did expreſs. 7. In the Priſon he made offer to ſome of his Brethren (a thing certain to me, albeit the Informer ſpeak doubtingly of it) that if it could be a mean to liberate him, he would give it under his hand, <hi>That what Mr.</hi> H. <hi>ſpoke was his very judgment.</hi> It will not be fit to take notice of every expreſſion, which in that Rhetorical flaunt, and to ſay no worſe, that windy rant, which the Hiſtorian hath about <hi>page</hi> 53. But as that worthy man Mr. <hi>B.</hi> if he were alive, would abhor the Hiſtorians overlaſhing commendations of him, to the defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of all his fellow Brethren: So it will not be unfit for the vindication of theſe, whom the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian labours to defame, to add a few particulars. 1. Some of theſe Miniſters who were before the Council did not take any of theſe papers in their hands, albeit they had never ſeen an authentick Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py before; others did, and ſo did Mr. <hi>B.</hi> whether he let his Copy drop out of his hand, I can neither affirm, nor deny, neither think I it any thing mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial: Others, for any thing I know, might alſo have
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:40126:182"/> dropped them after the ſame manner; but whether they did that, or whether they carried them away in their hands or pockets, is little to the purpoſe; for what ever Teſtimony he gave againſt the things contained therein, all the reſt gave the like, and large as much: and ſo whatever he did in perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating the Teſtimony of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the reſt did the like. 2. That his Impriſonment raiſed ſome noiſe in the City, I grant; but how it could carry with it ſome ſad reflection on the reſt, I cannot ſee, ſeeing they had given as full a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony as he had given, and they were not obliged to commit themſelves to Priſon, becauſe he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. 3. True it is, theſe Miniſters met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after his commitment, to deliberate, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly they could do any thing for his Releaſement, with whom alſo there met ſome ſerious and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Miniſters in the Town, who had met with them ſeveral times before. It is true, that ſome of theſe having heard the Forgeries and Lies which preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flew from about the Parliament-Houſe, did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and preſs the doing of ſomething for owning and ſeconding Mr. <hi>Blairs</hi> Teſtimony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this they did not out of ſhame and ſorrow for the unfaithfulneſs of the reſt, as the Hiſtorian inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, but for obſtructing the obloquy and clamour of the Vulgar. But every thing done and ſpoken before the Council by any, either in their own name, or in the name of others, being brought forth, conſidered, canvaſſed and examined, they were convinced, that any ſuch thing was needleſs and impertinent; yea, the taking of a groundleſs guilt upon them: What he hath farther here, is the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:40126:183"/> forgery of his eccho's at <hi>Edinburgh:</hi> 4 What he hath further here is nothing but forgery and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny; as that the proceedings of theſe Miniſters were point blank contrary to the actings of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Faithful in it, and that there was a motion made of writing about the Magiſtrates Power in Church matters, and that there was need of new Principles to juſtifie their proceedings. 5. I cannot paſs his raking into the aſhes of worthy Mr. <hi>H.</hi> If the compariſon were not a diſparagement to a Perſon of ſuch worth, I would ſay, that for grace, for gifts, for Miniſterial qualifications of all ſorts, for uſefulneſs in his Generation, and ſervice unto his Lord and Maſter therein, and for uſefulneſs to the Church of God in after Generations alſo. Mr. <hi>G. H.</hi> was a Perſon above the Hiſtorian, and that he was free both of <hi>Pedantus</hi> and <hi>Plagiarie,</hi> his moſt uſeful Works left behind him does declare; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in every thing is judiciouſly drawn out of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Word of God, and not by way of clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try out of Humane Authors, and that he had the leaſt tincture of the Opinion of <hi>Vedelius,</hi> is a thing that cannot be made out from his Writings or Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>Although I need not add any thing to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon,</hi> whoſe Works praiſe him in the Churches; yet having had occaſion to be intimately acquainted with him, and having found him miſrepreſented by ſome, I cannot forbear to do him right, after his death, in repreſenting him juſtly as I found him, in frequent converſing with him. I found him to be a very lovely man, of a ſweet, amiable, loving and compaſſionate diſpoſition;
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:40126:183"/> a man of great candour and ingenuity, and though of eminent gifts, yet very lowly and condeſcending to theſe, who were of low degree. I found him ready to receive light in Theology from thoſe who were every way far inferiour to him, as might be made out by many pregnant inſtances, and how much he was regretted, and his death lamented by the Godly Miniſters and Profeſſors in the place he lived, and through the Land is ſo well known and notore, that it were needleſs to be at pains to clear it to any that is in this our Church; his name for eminency in abilities Miniſterial of all kinds, and Piety, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſavoury and Famous therein, and his Works for the Churches good, ſo much approven, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded by eminent Divines abroad, together with the experience both of Godly and Judicious Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Profeſſors at home, do ſufficiently to the ſtopping of the mouth of all detraction and envy, commend him in the gate. 6 That the reſt of the Miniſters did reproach their Brother Mr. <hi>Blair,</hi> is a forgery, either minted in his own brain, or coined by ſome of his correſpondents. It's true, that ſome of theſe Miniſters, who did go to my L. Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour that Afternoon, to plead for his Releaſement, did declare, that my L.

I paſs his uncharitable inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation, <hi>That the reſt of the Miniſters had not pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that day for Counſel and Courage, in Order to their appearance,</hi> &amp;c. and Mr. <hi>Blairs</hi> telling of his attainments, though it be well known, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had the humour to talk of ſuch things; and ſome could have informed, <hi>That he bowed not the knee that morning, but in the company of, and in conjunction with two, who were lodged with him in the ſame Room.</hi> I paſs ſeveral other amplifications of this Hiſtorian, and ſhall mark a thing which he omits, which is this: <hi>Not long before his death,</hi> 24 <hi>hours at moſt, two ſerious and judicious Miniſters of the Goſpel viſiting him, and ſeeing that his time could not be long, did tell him, that he was now very ſhortly to compear before his Judge, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did urge him to tell, if he had Peace, in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of the Indulgence, and uſe making of it, theſe years by gone: To whom he replyed, That he had not the leaſt Challenge upon that account; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded moreover, that he could not have had Peace, in ſtaying from his Charge, Forcible and Legal reſtraints being removed.</hi> But our Faithful Hiſtorian paſſes this in ſilence, and alſo on the contrary, falſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, <hi>That he Witneſſed againſt the Indulgence,</hi> pag. 54. It's true indeed, that he with others Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt the Inſtructions, but that he Witneſſed againſt the Indulgence, is moſt falſe. From this it is clear alſo, that in his judgment, it was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Witneſs before the Council againſt theſe Inſtructions, or any other thing, ſuppoſed, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:40126:184"/> to be a concomitant to the Indulgence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they were particularly put to it; ſeeing without this, he had exerciſed his Miniſtry ſome years upon the account of the Indulgence, and that without a challenge. This Narration of the matter of Fact I have taken out of the Anſwer of the Hiſtory of the Indulgence: The Reverend Author of that Anſwer is a Perſon of that Piety, Candour, and Integrity, that none who know him, will call in Queſtion the truth of what he relates concerning his own actings, and the actings and ſpeeches of his Brethren, of which he was an eye and ear-witneſs; and which he was ſo much concerned to obſerve and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, upon many accounts, and which were kept in remembrance, not only by Papers, but by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates which preſently did ariſe upon theſe matters of Fact. I ſhall not ſay, that the Author of the Hiſtory of Indulgence hath Induſtriouſly forged falſhoods in matters of Fact, but hath written ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Informations ſent to him from ſome of his Correſpondents. Yet, I cannot but wonder, that ſeeing he would turn an Hiſtorian, and write a part of the Church-Hiſtory of the time in which he lived, that he hath ſo palpably tranſgreſſed the Laws of Hiſtory, in concealing truths, which tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Vindication of the Indulged Miniſters, in miſrepreſenting and miſconſtructing, and perverting their actions and ſpeeches, in publiſhing groſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths to their prejudice: And it will not juſtifie him that he had no better Information. For, 1. This was a fault to publiſh a Hiſtory of Church-matters, of ſuch importance and conſequence, without full and certain Information. 2. He might have had
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:40126:185"/> better Information, if he would have ſought for it, and ſeeing he would write a Hiſtory, he was in Conſcience obliged to have made a moſt diligent ſearch for truth, and impartially received and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated it. 3. It was a fault, that he received his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations from Perſons diſaffected to the Indulged Miniſters, and did not ſend to the Indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to hear what they had to ſay, concerning their practice, and the Reaſons of it, he ſhould have had two ears, and followed the old direction, <hi>audi al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teram partem,</hi> and the rather becauſe, he not only as an Hiſtorian, relates matters of Fact, but upon theſe, he forms grievous Libels, Accuſations, and Cenſures, he ſhould have heard them before he had publickly condemned them. 4. If he had conſidered, that it's one of the Devils grand deſigns in this time, to bring the Miniſters of the Goſpel, and the Goſpel with them into contempt, and had conſidered how effectually a lying Spirit works in ſome of this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and how many ſhameleſs, ſenſeleſs lies, which have no appearance of truth, or probability, but have manifeſt Evidences of falſhood in their face, are confidently vented againſt Miniſters, eſpecially Indulged Miniſters, it would have made him more cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elous, in receiving Informations of that nature; and he would not have ſuffered himſelf to be ſo miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably abuſed, in receiving, nor would he have abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed others, in publiſhing ſuch falſhoods. It's ſad to ſee how much the Father of Lies, and the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of the Brethren, hath prevailed by theſe calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and ſlanders, to bring almoſt all Miniſters to be deſpiſed by ſome. But the Lord who is excellent in working, and brings good out of evil, hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:40126:185"/> many in their adherence to the Miniſtry of his Servants, and particularly to the Miniſtry of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Miniſters, and hath reclaimed ſome, who were beginning to be diſaffected to them, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them to obſerve the activity of the Father of Lies, in calumniating theſe Miniſters; for the Lies being palpable, that any who will not ſhut their eyes, may ſee them to proceed from the Father of Lies. They conclude, that there muſt be good in the Miniſtry of the Indulged Miniſters, ſeeing the Father of Lies doth ſet himſelf ſo much againſt it.</p>
               <p>From the preceding Relation of the matter of Fact, the Faithfulneſs of theſe Miniſters, who were convened before the Council, <hi>July</hi> 1673. is very evident. For ſuppoſe, it had fallen out, that they had gotten leave to ſpeak nothing before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, yet their unanimous agreeing in the paper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, and their appointing one of their number in their preſence to ſpeak the ſubſtance of that paper to the Magiſtrate; and their declared Reſolution, to adhere to what was ſpoken accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, doth evidence their Faithfulneſs and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity. 2. Although, it's likely, that if that jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble had not fallen in, through the Commitment of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to a Macer, more would have been ſaid; yet that which was ſpoken was a Faithful Teſtimony, even in the judgment of the Author of the Hiſtory of the Indulgence; for he grants that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> gave an honeſt Teſtimony, and he aſſerts, and very ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally proves, that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſpoke the ſame upon the matter with Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and added ſome more, <hi>That a Power formally Eccleſiaſtical could not be allowed
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:40126:186"/> to the Magiſtrate,</hi> and ſeveral others ſpoke to the ſame purpoſe with Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> 3. That Obedience to theſe Inſtructions, was refuſed, is clear from the Chancellours Anſwer to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> which was in theſe words, <hi>Then we will puniſh you.</hi> And hence it is evident, that as the Impoſitions and Rules intrinſically Eccleſiaſtical, Eccleſiaſtick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, Rules regulating Miniſters in the Exerciſe of their Miniſtry, were fit terms to deſign the Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Inſtructions which were in the Council's Acts, as the Author of the Hiſtory acknowledges; for he acknowledges, that ſome of them were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed formally and intrinſically Eccleſiaſtical, <hi>pag.</hi> 65. And he cannot but acknowledge that all of them were Impoſitions; and as the words they uſed, ſo the time, and place, and occaſion, upon which they were ſpoken to the Council by theſe Miniſters, and the ſpecial Reaſons given againſt ſome of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, did clearly Evidence, that theſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſpoke of the Injunctions and Inſtructions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der debate; ſo we ſee that the Magiſtrate underſtood it ſo; for he would not have threatned to puniſh them for not obſerving Inſtructions which he had not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them: And as they declared they could not receive theſe Inſtructions, ſo they declared they could not accept of any Inſtructions of that nature from the Magiſtrate, and ſo this was not a blind, as he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, <hi>pag.</hi> 65. but a <hi>vidimus:</hi> By which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate might ſee, that they could not receive any ſuch Rules from their Lordſhips. This cuts off a great many of the Hiſtorians Quibblings. Having ſufficiently cleared theſe Miniſters, I ſhall briefly touch upon ſome things which the Hiſtorian carps
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:40126:186"/> at. He quarrels, <hi>pag.</hi> 64, 65. at that Aſſertion, <hi>That we would not receive from the Magiſtrate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions formally and intrinſically Eccleſiaſtical, for regulating us in the exerciſe of our Miniſtry.</hi> And ſays, <hi>That he would not have been for ſubſcribing a Paper, which had this in it, nor yet for uſing it as a directory.</hi> He is for the Aſſertion, if the words <hi>formally and intrinſically Eccleſiaſtical</hi> were out; but the putting of theſe words in did put him out of all conceit with this Aſſertion. This is ſtrange, that words which do no way overturn or vitiate that Aſſertion, but clear it, ſhould have made ſuch an alteration upon him; that which was a mean of harmony, and ended all debate among the Brethren, would have divided him from his Brethren, in this matter: I ſee he would have done ill, if he had been preſent, and no good; and yet it may be if he had been preſent among his Brethren, and heard their reaſonings, he might have been better In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. It's a great loſs to ſome, eſpecially if they have much of ſelf-conceit, to be alone, and left to their own ſolitary imagination. But let us hear what he hath to ſay againſt this Aſſertion: He falls upon it with <hi>Dilemma</hi>'s, which threaten with two terrible horns. <hi>Which</hi> (ſays he) <hi>in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was either nothing to the purpoſe, or which is worſe, was a betraying of the Cauſe.</hi> How! no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than Folly, Foppery, or elſe Falſhood and Treachery: Theſe Brethren had need to take heed to themſelves, for he hath a dreadful Deſign upon them, to bereave them either of their Wit or Honeſty; he will be ſure, if they be not aware, to puſh one of his horns through their head, and if
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:40126:187"/> that miſs, he will gore with the other through the heart, he will have them to be either Fools or Knaves. If the puſhing of this horned Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be anſwerable to its bellowing and lowing, there will be a dreadful Encounter and great loſs. But now having ſhaken theſe two terrible horns, and given them fair warning, what parts to guard, he makes a nearer approach. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this was underſtood in reference to thoſe Rules, which the Council preſcribed in their Act,</hi> Sept. 3. 1672. <hi>or not.</hi> Yes; be ſure it is either the Fox or the fern-buſh: But he makes ſurer work than ſo, for the horns of this <hi>Dilemma</hi> are contradictory, and the Brethren muſt of neceſſity fall upon one of them; but there is no hazard yet, for the one of the horns is harmleſs, it's for them, and they for it; their aſſertion had reference to theſe Rules. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, and ſhews them two new horns: <hi>For</hi> (ſays he) <hi>if it was underſtood with this reference, then either hereby, they meant to juſtifie and defend their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to accept of theſe Inſtructions, or to juſtifie their accepting of them.</hi> This laſt horn hath a terrible appearance, it's an uncouth, unexpected horn; but there is no hazard, for be what it will, it is no horn; for it hath no ſolidity when ye gripe it; and no wonder, for it is but a Phantaſm, one of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors vain imaginations; the Brethren never dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ſuch a thing, as accepting, or juſtifying of acceptance; and as the Author lightly made this fantaſtick horn, the Brethren do as lightly make nothing of it, by diſowning it, and ſo it's evaniſhed; light come, light gone. The Brethren meant by this Aſſertion, to refuſe, and to juſtifie their refuſing
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:40126:187"/> to accept of theſe Inſtructions. But he will prove that they meant not to refuſe, and juſtifie their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to accept of theſe Inſtructions. 1. Says he, <hi>Why then was Mr.</hi> Blair <hi>ſo much condemned, who did but refuſe the accepting of theſe, that had been expreſſed in the Act, and were then exhibited.</hi> The Argument runs thus; <hi>The Brethren condemned Mr.</hi> Blair <hi>for refuſing the Inſtructions, and therefore they meant not to refuſe them.</hi> The conſequence is pretty good, but the antecedent is naught, it's manifeſtly falſe; never did any of the Brethren condemn Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> for refuſing of the Inſtructions, for that was the thing which they had all agreed to do, and which they did. But 2. Says he, <hi>Why was it not plainly affirmed, that they would not receive theſe, which the Council tendred unto them. Anſw.</hi> It was ſo plainly affirmed, that the Chancellour ſaid, <hi>Then we will puniſh you.</hi> And as Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> did plainly refuſe them, ſo did others, and particularly Mr. <hi>H.</hi> as the Author of the Hiſtory not only grants, but proves, when he proves that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſaid the ſame upon the matter with Mr. <hi>B.</hi> 3. Sath he, <hi>Why was there ſo much debate about a general Theſis, when the clear aſſertion of the Hypotheſis, would have ſalved both Credit and Conſcience? Anſw.</hi> This Argument is of the ſame nature with he reſt, that is, ſtark naught; there was a great d bate amongſt the Miniſters about the wording of ageneral The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, and therefore they meant not to refuſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and to juſtifie their refual. If it had been a Queſtion among them, whetler they ſhould accept of theſe Inſtructions or not, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e might have made ſo mething out of that Queſtion, againſt any
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:40126:188"/> that had held the affirmative, if they had continued in that Opinion, but that was not ſo much as brought under debate; they were clear, they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe Inſtructions; and to prevent the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any more injunctions of that nature upon them, they reſolved to ſet down a general Theſis, which might exclude all Inſtructions and Injunctions of the Magiſtrate, which might incroach and intrench upon the Calling of the Miniſtry. And any who have ſtudied and underſtood that Queſtion of the bounds of the Magiſtrates, and Miniſters Power and Authority, will not wonder, if there was a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time taken up in that Debate, <hi>De finibus.</hi> They who are moſt ignorant, are often moſt confident in their deciſions of theſe queſtions; but I ſuppoſe it will be ordinarily found that they who think there is no difficulty in ridding theſe Marches, are either Perſons who have not read theſe queſtions, or have not underſtood what they read. If I had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with theſe Brethren, at that Debate, I could have better anſwered his Queſtion, <hi>Why there was ſo much debate about this general Theſis:</hi> Yet as it's obvious, that it was very convenient, that they ſhould agree upon a general Theſis, which might prevent invaſions upon the Miniſterial Calling, or at leaſt diſcover them, that they might not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with: So it was not eaſie to ſet down a general Rule in ſuch tickliſh matter, which would admit of no except<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> thought the Aſſertion might ſtand, as it was firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>onceived, without the addition of the words <hi>formally and intrinſically Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> had much to ſay fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> their Opinion; that it was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:40126:188"/> for the Magiſtrate to inſtruct and teach Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, how to exerciſe their Miniſtry, or to form Inſtructions, Regulating Miniſters in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry: For the forming and preſcribing Rules or Canons of that nature, is the proper <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, Intrinſick</hi> exerciſe, of Eccleſiaſtick Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: As it is not competent for Miniſters to make Civil Laws and Statutes, ſo it is not competent for Magiſtrates to make Eccleſiaſtick Inſtructions, Rules, or Canons, Regulating Miniſters in the exerciſe of their Miniſterial Function; for this would bring the Magiſtrate in upon the Calling of the Miniſtry, and confound theſe Callings, which the Lord hath made diſtinct. Again, the Brethren, who thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to add the words <hi>formally and intrinſically Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> have conſidered, that although the Aſſertion, without this addition, in its genuine ſenſe, was ſound, yet it might be Interpreted by Perſons diſpoſed to Cavil and Calumniate in a wrong ſenſe, which would not agree with the judgment of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eraſtian</hi> Divines; who though they do not allow to the Magiſtrate a Power <hi>Formally</hi> Eccleſiaſtical, and ſo allow not to him a Power of forming Canons Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, Regulating Miniſters in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry; yet they allow to the Magiſtrate Power to Command Miniſters to exerciſe their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and to do their Office according to the Word of God. In the firſt Chapter of the Second Book of Diſcipline we have theſe words. <hi>The Civil Power ſhould Command the Spiritual to exerciſe, and do their Office according to the Word of God.</hi> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in that ſame Chapter, <hi>The Magiſtrate nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought to Preach, adminiſter the Sacraments, nor
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:40126:189"/> execute the Cenſures of the Kirk, nor yet preſcribe any Rule how it ſhould be done, but Command the Miniſters to obſerve the Rule Commanded in the Word, and puniſh the Tranſgreſſors by Civil means.</hi> And Chap. 10. which is of the Office of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrate, in the Church, we have theſe words: <hi>That it pertains to the Office of a Chriſtian Magiſtrate to ſee, that the Kirk be not invaded, nor hurt by falſe Teachers and Hirelings, nor the rooms thereof be occupied by dumb dogs and idle bellies: To aſſiſt and maintain the Diſcipline of the Kirk, and puniſh them Civilly, that will not Obey the Cenſure of the ſame, without confounding always the one Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction with the other.</hi> And afterwards they add, <hi>To make Laws and Conſtitutions agreeable to Gods Word, for advancement of the Kirk and Policy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, without Uſurping any thing that pertains not to the Civil Sword, but belongs to the Offices that are meerly Eccleſiaſtical, as is the Miniſtry of the Word and Sacraments, uſing Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, and the Spiritual execution thereof; or any part of the Power of the Spiritual Keys, which our Maſter gave to the Apoſtles and their true Succeſſours. And although Kings and Princes, that be Godly, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by their own Authority, when the Kirk is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and all things out of Order, place Miniſters, and reſtore the true Service of the Lord, after the Example of ſome Godly Kings of</hi> Judah, <hi>and divers Godly Kings and Emperours, in the Light of the New Teſtament; yet, where the Miniſtry of the Kirk is once Lawfully Conſtitute, and they that are placed, do their Office Faithfully, all Godly Princes and Magiſtrates ought to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>The Author of the Hiſtory of the Indulgence, <hi>pag.</hi> 62. grants that conceſſion of Orthodox <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eraſtian</hi> Divines, <hi>That Magiſtrates may and ſhould put Miniſters to their Duty, in following the Rules and Injunctions preſcribed by Chriſt, in their Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal way, and by their Political Penalties:</hi> And hence it will follow, that Miniſters ſhould not refuſe Chriſts injunctions, becauſe the Magiſtrate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them to obſerve them, and by their Political Power and Political Penalties, puts them to obſerve them. He grants alſo, <hi>That Magiſtrates may Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy confirm, and inforce Canons and Rules, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterially cleared and concluded by Church Judicatories.</hi> And <hi>pag.</hi> 63. He diſtinguiſhes Inſtructions, into theſe which are concerning ſuch things, as are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways neceſſary to the right exerciſe of the Miniſtry, or are concerning alterable Circumſtances; which onely <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> can be called neceſſary: And concerning the former, he ſaith, <hi>That the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate cannot enjoyn theſe Miniſterially, as holding forth the mind of God, becauſe ſo he would not be a Magiſtrate, but a Miniſter.</hi> But he grants, <hi>That the Magiſtrate may Politically inforce theſe Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in a well Reformed and Inſtituted Church, after they have been Miniſterially held forth, by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized Miniſterial Interpreters of the Word.</hi> And in a Church confuſed and needing Reformation, he does not deny to the Magiſtrate a Power to enjoyn ſuch things, as are at all times neceſſary, to the right exerciſe of the Miniſtry: But he alledges, <hi>This latter Caſe is not ours.</hi> But it ſeems he hath not conſidered

If the Caſe of this Church had not been confuſed, he durſt not have written and Printed ſuch a Hiſtory, nor written Letters to encourage ſome young Men to counteract the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Miniſters of this Church, and to refuſe to be ſubject to them; he might poſſibly, when he was in another Nation, in his ſtudy among his Books, imagine that this Church was not confuſed, but well ordered, and needing no Reformation. But alas, our Confuſions and Diſorders are more real than to be removed by the force of his imagination: We ſee them, we find them, and they who have any ſenſe groan under them; and we want theſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, which were a part of the Order of this Church, and the means to preſerve Order, to prevent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, or rectifie Diſorders, if they had entred. But he will prove, that this Church is not confuſed and needing Reformation. I wiſh he could prove this; but I have found his former Arguings ſo fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious, that I fear this proof prove like the reſt; that is, prove nothing. But let us hear him: <hi>The latter Caſe</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is not our Caſe, unleſs by this conceſſion we would grant Power and Liberty to any Magiſtrate to overturn the beſt Reformed Church; that is, to the end he may order all things in it as he pleaſeth, which was never underſtood by the uſers of this diſtinction.</hi> The Argument runs thus: <hi>If we grant that this Church is confuſed, and needs Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, we grant a Power and Liberty to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to overturn the beſt Reformed Church,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but we cannot grant a Power to the Magiſtrate to overturn,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and therefore we cannot grant that
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:40126:190"/> this Church is confuſed, and needs Reformation.</hi> The firſt propoſition is manifeſtly falſe: This is a hard caſe, that a poor Church confuſed and diſordered, may not confeſs to God, nor declare before Men, that it is confuſed, and needs Reformation, may not relate its caſe, as it is, but it muſt, by the confeſſion or conceſſion of the truth, become guilty of giving Power and Liberty to the Magiſtrate to overturn the Church. There's no ſhadow of Reaſon for this connexion; although the Church confeſs that the Magiſtrate hath overturned her, that grants no Power and Liberty to the Magiſtrate to overturn the Church. Does a poor mans complaint, that his Neighbour hath come in and made Abuſe and Diſorder in his Houſe, grant a power and liberty to his Neigbour, to make Abuſe and Diſorder, or a Power to Order all things in it as he pleaſeth? Shall the complaint of an injurious Fact grant a Power and Liberty to do injury? The Magiſtrates Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things in the Church as he pleaſeth, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently brought in under this head, for he is ſpeaking of Inſtructions ſet down in the Word of God, and which are concerning things, at all times, neceſſary to the right exerciſe of the Miniſtry. If the Magiſtrate would give only ſuch Injunctions, I ſuppoſe few would complain; for all grant, that the Magiſtrate may put Miniſters to do their neceſſary Duty, preſcribed to them in the Word of God. As to the alterable circumſtances, he excludes the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate from any Power in reference to theſe; but he doth not prove what he ſays, for though the Church have power to determine ſuch Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, according to the general Rules of the Word,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:40126:191"/> it will not follow, that the Magiſtrate hath no power in reference to theſe Circumſtances: If he had ſaid, that the Church onely hath that power, and proved what he ſaid, he would have ſaid ſomething. <hi>If the Church hath Power</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by what Law can the Church be robbed of that Power given by Chriſt?</hi> They will eaſily Anſwer, That the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate may have power, in reference to ſome Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and exerciſe that power, and yet not rob the Church of any power which Chriſt hath given to it. For both the Magiſtrate and Church may have ſome power, in reference to theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Circumſtances, and exerciſe it, and yet not rob one another of the power which they have; as there are ſome Commons for Paſturage, which all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the adjacent bounds may make uſe of for Paſturage, and yet not rob one another. Then he queſtions, by what right can the judgment of this matter be committed <hi>in prima inſtantia,</hi> at the very firſt unto the Magiſtrate, or rather wholly and ſolely to him. But this Queſtion alters the ſtate of the Queſtion; for the Magiſtrate may have power, in reference to theſe Circumſtances, though he have not the ſole power; the Author of the late Apology, <hi>pag.</hi> 169. &amp; 170. ſhews, That both Magiſtrates and Miniſters may upon the diſpenſation of Mercy and Judgment call for Thankſgiving or Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, indict days of Humiliation and Thankſgiving; and acknowledges, that for more harmony in this publick work, and convenient following of it, with benefit and advantage, to Church and State, it were expedient that Magiſtrates and Miniſters did previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſult. And <hi>pag.</hi> 167, 168. He ſhews,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:40126:191"/> That Magiſtrates may Convocate Synods: But this is not privative of the power of Church-Officers, who may and ought to come together of themſelves, as the neceſſities of the Church requires.</p>
               <p>The Author of the Anſwer to the Hiſtory of the Indulgence, hath very rationally ſhewed, that if the Magiſtrate appoint the <hi>Thurſday</hi> of any week, to be a Muſter-day in every Pariſh of his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he may diſcharge any Publick Sermon upon that <hi>Thurſday:</hi> This is an extrinſecal circumſtantial regulating or limiting of the Publick exerciſe of the Miniſtry, which cannot in Reaſon be denied to the Magiſtrate, who finds it neceſſary to have a Muſter of all his Subjects who are fit to carry Arms in one day. To give the Magiſtrate an unlimited power in Circumſtantials, were to give him a deſtructive power; for ſo he might appoint a Houſe for Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip, which would not contain the third part of the Pariſh: And to give him no power in reference to Circumſtantials, were unreaſonable; and to imagine the Marches betwixt Magiſtrates and Miniſters, can be Mathematically defined, and brought to a very Mathematical point, is a conceit that will not readily come in the head of any man, who hath read and underſtood any thing of theſe Queſtions: And I perceive the Hiſtorian himſelf hath a Latitude to come and go upon; for <hi>pag.</hi> 81, &amp; 82. where he ſays, <hi>And I ſhall willingly grant, that what agreeth to Magiſtrates, as ſuch, agreeth to all Magiſtrates good and bad; yet it may be maintained that more may be allowed in ſuch Magiſtrates, as are really minding Reformation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>than in ſuch as are open Enemies thereunto,</hi> &amp;c. And, I ſuppoſe, this
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:40126:192"/> is one Reaſon of difference among Divines in theſe matters; ſome who have lived under Reforming Magiſtrates, have allowed more, and others who have lived under Magiſtrates who abuſed their power have allowed leſs; and when theſe conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are calculated, according to the diſpoſition of Rulers, which are ſo variable, and not according to the Rule of the Word of God, and the natures and ends of the Magiſtratical and Miniſterial Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; What wonder, if their conceſſions vary one from another? All theſe things being conſidered, it was no wonder, that theſe Brethren thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, to add the clauſe <hi>Formally and Intrinſecally Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> to caſt off the Cavils of theſe who would have alledged, that the Aſſertion without this did deny all power to the Magiſtrate about the extrinſick Circumſtantials of the exerciſe of the Miniſtry. And thus, I have given ſome Reaſon, why there was ſo much debate about that general Theſis: The Brethren who were preſent at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, can, no doubt, ſay much more than either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e or I could dream of; for there were many there who could have taught both him and me in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or in any Theologick Queſtion. In wording of the Aſſertion, they were to look not onely to the ſalving of their Credit and Conſcience among their Friends, who would candidly Interpret their words, but alſo to obviate the cavils of Adverſaries, who were waiting for their halting, and would have been glad of any pretext to have rendred them odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Magiſtrate. The Hiſtorian goeth on in that 65 <hi>pag.</hi> upon that ſuppoſition, that the Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was thus qualified, to juſtifie their accepting of
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:40126:192"/> theſe Rules, and upon this ſuppoſition, he infers, that then the cauſe ſure was betrayed, &amp;c. <hi>uno ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdo dato mille ſequuntur.</hi> If ye will give him leave to lay a Foundation in the Air of his own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, he will build Caſtles in the Air; but it were a very idle work, for me to ſpend time in caſting down theſe Caſtles, which have no Foundation but his falſe imagination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Further</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I ſuppoſe it will be found, that ſome of theſe Inſtructions were indeed Formally and Intrinſecally Eccleſiaſtical, and if theſe were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, they ſhould have been particularly mentioned, that all might have been clear. Anſw.</hi> Then the addition of the words <hi>Formally and Intrinſecally Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical,</hi> to the Aſſertion, did exclude theſe, and all of that nature, and ſo was added to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and why then would he not have ſubſcribed this Paper, or uſed it for a directory? Was it the worſe that it did directly exclude theſe Rules, which did intrench moſt upon the Miniſterial Office? If he ſay, that the excepting of theſe, was an accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the reſt: I Anſwer, He grants, that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> refuſed all, and that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſaid the ſame upon the matter, with Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and therefore all were refuſed. The confinement with all the reſt of the Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was ſpoken againſt by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> as Impoſitions burdening their Miniſtry, and Reaſons given why their Miniſtry ſhould not be burdened with theſe Impoſitions. And the addition of the foreſaid words, was no ways deſtructive to the words that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſpoke to the Chancellour; for if Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had thought them to be ſo, he would never have acquieſced to them, in the meeting, nor have acknowledged af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:40126:193"/> that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſpoke his mind; and therefore if the words, as ſpoken by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> were an honeſt Teſtimony, then Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon</hi>'s words, which were the ſame, and more ample, were an honeſt Teſtimony; but enough of this before. And thus we ſee, that the horrible horned Argument, with which he ſo terribly threatned theſe Brethren, hath done no hurt, but to himſelf; he hath raiſed duſt, which hath blinded his own eyes, and expoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the laughter or pity of the beholders: And it is really a great pity, that he who was fit for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter work, ſhould have ſo abuſed himſelf, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted his precious time, in paſſing judgment againſt his Brethren, who were Judicious and Conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Miniſters, as men who after a long Debate, concluded, that which was nothing to the purpoſe or a betraying of the Cauſe: And inſtead of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Reaſons to confirm this Charge, bringing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but falſhoods and ridiculous Fopperies.</p>
               <p>It were but a waſting of time, and an abuſing of the Readers patience, to go through all his jumblings againſt the Informer; for many things in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers are nothing to the purpoſe in hand.</p>
               <p>His inſinuation, <hi>pag.</hi> 65. <hi>That the Lord was away from theſe Brethren, and ſo Light and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel could not remain with them,</hi> is full of Inſolent boldneſs and raſhneſs; he ought in Charity to have ſuppoſed that theſe Brethren were met in Chriſts name, and that the Lord was in the midſt of them, and with them. If he had conſidered what he ſays in the end of that page, and beginning of the next, of the inconſiderableneſs of one or two abandoning the reſt of their Brethren, it might have made him
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:40126:193"/> and his Colleague a little more modeſt in their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and extravagant conceits ſo contrary to the ſentiments of the Suffering Miniſters of the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi> He alledges, <hi>pag.</hi> 66. <hi>That they who were not clear for giving in a ſubſcribed Paper to the Council, could not be very clear, as to the matter of the Paper:</hi> The proof of this is in a <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> (I judge) <hi>ipſe dixit;</hi> and ſo all is ſure, and the Reader muſt acquieſce, it's <hi>res judicata,</hi> and ſo there is no more place for Debate. His thinking ſtrange that theſe Miniſters could not do that which he thinks every Miniſter and Servant of Chriſt ſhould be ready to give, upon leſs than a few hours warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yea, at the firſt demand, makes me apprehend, he hath not well underſtood the difficulty of rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Marches, betwixt Magiſtrates and Miniſters. He who thinks that any Servant of Chriſt, can at demand, and off hand, decide that Queſtion, <hi>de fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> does not underſtand it, or elſe he is a man of great abilities, and withal ſo Charitable, as to think every Miniſter as able as himſelf. If I had been upon the Hiſtorians Counſel, I would have adviſed him, to have forborn the Imprecation which he hath, <hi>pag.</hi> 67. §. 4. and that for his own ſake; for if he by other papers, and by this Hiſtory, hath not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred fuel to this fire, very many are much miſtaken. Page 68. he inveighs much againſt Mr. <hi>H.</hi> for not ſpeaking ſooner, and not inſinuating Reaſons, why they could not in Conſcience accept of theſe Impoſitions; but he himſelf hath cleared Mr. <hi>H.</hi> for before theſe papers were delivered, Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon</hi> gave an honeſt Teſtimony againſt theſe Impoſitions, for he ſaid the ſame, upon the matter,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:40126:194"/> which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaid, which the Author commends as an honeſt Teſtimony. And <hi>pag.</hi> 70. proves that there was upon the matter no difference betwixt Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. words. Page 71. he wrongs the Informer, in alledging that he gives to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate a diatactick power in an illimited and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified manner, as he doth (ſaith the Hiſtorian) when he talks of the diatactick power of both; for this is a manifeſt homologating of the Supremacy, as lately explained by the Parliament: For the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former ſpeaks not of the manner of the Magiſtrates diatactick power at all, and much leſs of an illimited manner of his power. The Author hath in the beginning of this page, blamed the Informer, for putting one term more than he ſhould in a Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm, and yet I find not that Logical eſcape in the Informers paper, which I have, and if the Informe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But the Informer aſcribes to the Magiſtrate a diatactick power, and therefore he aſcribes it in an illimited manner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is to reaſon without any ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Reaſon; for there is a manifeſt difference, and no appearance of identity betwixt a power dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tactick and the illimited manner that he ſpeaks of, <hi>res differt à modo rei &amp; praecipue à modo illimitato hoc eſt à modo, qui modum neſcit.</hi> Neither the word power, nor the word diatactick, nor both of them joyned together, do import an illimited boundleſs manner, and to infer from the term diatactick, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limitedneſs, is to draw confuſion, out of Order, and <hi>quidlibet ex quolibet.</hi> I wonder that the Author did not alledge alſo, that the Informer aſcribed this illimited, unqualified manner of diatactick power, and a Spiritual Supremacy, to Church Judicatories; for he aſcribes this diatactick power to theſe alſo, and hath not the leaſt inſinuation, that he aſcribes it in an illimited manner to the Magiſtrate, but in a limited to them. But the Author hath been in an ill humour, and ill humours makes ill Arguments: Paſſion prompts men to make Reproaches, but hath no patience to make Syllogiſms, or to take leiſure to examine, whether they be right or wrong: It diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figures both body and mind, and puts men in an ill mood, and therefore it's no wonder, if it keep nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mode nor figure, in Reaſoning. Page 171, 172. he takes upon him to be an Inſtructor to the Informer; but the Informer knew as well as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:40126:195"/> if not ſomewhat better, that the Magiſtrate hath no Power to make Rules <hi>Formally Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> for that is the work of Eccleſiaſtical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, nor to give injunctions, or commands, which are not good to Miniſters; but after all his Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Informer, I ſuppoſe, would have inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at him, if the Magiſtrate, when it is needful, may not command lazy Miniſters to be diligent in the work of the Miniſtry; if he be certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that Popiſh Emiſſaries are ſent in among his Subjects, to poiſon them with Error and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, may he not command the Miniſters of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, in their Doctrine, and Catechiſing to guard the People againſt Popery; if he find ſome preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Worſhip of Images, or miſpending the time in repeating <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Sentences to ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant People, who knows neither <hi>Greek</hi> nor <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> may he not diſcharge them to teach Idolatry, and command them to ſpeak in a known tongue? If he find ſome not obſerving ſome good and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Acts of the general Aſſembly, may he not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to obſerve theſe Acts? May he not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge Preaching, in publick, in a general Muſter-day? I ſuppoſe, the Hiſtorian would not, if here-membred the conceſſions of Orthodox Divines, and the Second book of Diſcipline, deny this to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate. Then the Informer would inquire, if Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters obeying of theſe Commands, were a deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, to be onely head of his Church, or a receiving injunctions from an Uſurper, and a ceaſing to be Ambaſſadours of Chriſt. Is their doing that, which the Magiſtrate may Lawfully, and in ſome caſes ought to command, a crime of ſo horrid a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:40126:195"/> If it be not, then the Informer is where he was, &amp; he will tell him, that then the Magiſtrate, though he may not make Eccleſiaſtick Canons, yet he hath a diatactick Power, or a commanding Power, to enjoyn Miniſters to do their Duty, and ought to make uſe of it when there is need: And to enforce theſe Magiſtratical commands, with Civil Penalties; as Miniſters may, as Ambaſſadours of Chriſt, exhort Magiſtrates to do their Duty; ſo Magiſtrates, as Gods Vicegerents, may command Miniſters to do their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp; yet neither Miniſters may make Civil Statutes, nor Magiſtrates Eccleſiaſtick Canons or Rules.</p>
               <p>The Arguments by which he would perſwade the Indulged Miniſters, in the end of <hi>pag.</hi> 72 and <hi>pag.</hi> 73. not to Preach in the Pariſhes to which they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, would conclude, if they concluded any thing, that <hi>John</hi> ſhould not have exerciſed his Miniſtry in <hi>Patmos,</hi> nor <hi>Paul</hi> in his hired Houſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> for they were declared no free Subjects, and were under the ſcandal, as he calls it, of diſloyal and cenſured perſons: And this expoſed them, and their Miniſtry to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in the World; but this did not render their pains fruitleſs, as he alledges <hi>Paul</hi>'s bonds were to the furtherance of the Goſpel, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.12, 13, 14. I wiſh the Author and ſome others had not been too like to theſe, who added affliction to <hi>Paul</hi>'s bonds. I wiſh that all concerned, may examine, whether there hath not been Preaching and Writing, out of ſtrife and envy, and contention. After all he hath ſaid, about Miniſters confinement, it is but too clear, even from what he grants, that their confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is an extrinſick, local reſtraint of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their Miniſtry. In that 73 <hi>pag.</hi> he grants
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:40126:196"/> again, that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſpoke the ſame upon the matter with Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and that another ſaid, that divers Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters (the Brother who hath Anſwered this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, who was preſent, ſaith, it was the reſt of the Miniſters) of that company, were upon the matter of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. judgment, whereof himſelf was one; and the anſwerer adds, that one ſaid, with an audible voice, <hi>I adhere to what Mr.</hi> B. <hi>hath ſpoken:</hi> And another added, <hi>That one of theſe Rules did bring Miniſters into a direct ſubjection to Prelacy contrary to their Principles.</hi> And after he hath obſerved, that the conſternation was not ſo univerſal, as the Informer did hint, (the Informer did ſpeak of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of Spirit, but univerſal conſternation was minted by himſelf, but not hinted by the Informer) he ſays, he paſſes theſe ſmall matters, and is that a ſmall matter, that the reſt of theſe Miniſters, were upon the matter of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But any thing which was ſo manifeſtly right, in theſe Brethren, that he knew not what he could ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, he paſſes it as ſmall, and makes nothing of it. But I wonder with what face or Conſcience, he could call theſe Brethren, who in the face of the Council did homologate what Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> ſaid, Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. deſerting Brethren, <hi>pag.</hi> 54. where he ſays, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> was reſcued from the reproaches of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting Brethren.

This ſhould put all, to be much in Praying, that they be not led into temptation. And <hi>pag.</hi> 53. he ſays they left Mr. <hi>B.</hi> alone; did they leave him alone before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:40126:196"/> when they, according to the Authors own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, ſpoke the ſame upon the matter, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared they were of his judgment? Or does he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to render them odious, becauſe they left Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in Priſon? Would he have had them impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, and deſerting their Paroches, and the exerciſe of their Miniſtry, becauſe Mr. <hi>B.</hi> was impriſoned? Had there been either Knowledge, or Conſcience in ſhutting up themſelves in Priſon with Mr. <hi>B.</hi> but any thing will furniſh matter of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation to an angry and prejudiced Perſon. Page 74. he again brings out a horned Argument againſt Mr. <hi>H. Who,</hi> he ſays, <hi>by Rules intrinſically Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical, meant either the Rules which were then offered to Mr.</hi> B. <hi>or ſome other.</hi> I Anſwer, he meant both theſe Rules and all other of the ſame nature; and ſo his two horns are turned into one. He goes on: <hi>If ſome other, then he could not deſire their Lordſhips not to miſunderſtand Mr.</hi> B. <hi>for Mr.</hi> B. <hi>meant and ſpoke of the Rules, which were tendred to him. Anſw.</hi> No doubt he ſpoke of theſe which were tendred to him, but any body that reads Mr. <hi>Blairs</hi> words, will ſee that Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. words are more univerſal, than to relate onely to theſe Rules; for, he ſays, he could receive no Rules, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He adds, <hi>Nor could he then be ſuppoſed to be ſpeaking any thing in favours of Mr.</hi> B. <hi>whether by way of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, Defence, or Explication. Anſw.</hi> He is far miſtaken in his ſuppoſition; for what Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſaid againſt all Rules of that nature, was a juſtifying of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> refuſing of theſe Rules, and all of that kind, any ſuch, as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> words it, he juſtified the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of all Rules of the Magiſtrates making and
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:40126:197"/> impoſing, which did intrench upon Eccleſiaſtical Authority: And thus, he both defends and explains Mr. <hi>Blairs</hi> Speech; and gives a Reaſon, why their Lordſhips could not make ſuch Rules, becauſe they were intrinſically Eccleſiaſtical, and ſo the making of them was the intrinſick and formal exerciſe of the Eccleſiaſtical Authority of Church-Officers. He adds another Reaſon, <hi>That in theſe matters, which were the exerciſe of their Miniſtry, they were the Servants of Chriſt; and therefore the Magiſtrate ſhould not impoſe upon them, in theſe matters.</hi> The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor grants, that ſome of theſe Rules were formally Eccleſiaſtical, which the Magiſtrate could not make, and all of them are burdenſom impoſitions, clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the exerciſe of the Miniſtry. The enjoyning the Religious obſervation of the 29th. of <hi>May,</hi> by commanding ceſſation from work, and affixing a ſpecial kind of Worſhip to that day, was contrary to the Principle of theſe, who think none can make Holy-days but God; the diſcharging of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, the reading and giving the ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was not to Edification, but an impeding of a mean of Edification; the referring cauſes, from Seſſions to Presbyteries, as now conſtitute, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Principle of Presbyterians, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not put themſelves in a ſubordination to Prelacy; the reſtraining Miniſters from Baptizing Children of other Congregations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though formerly it did well, yet did not quadrate with the preſent ſtate of the Church; the injunction to have the Communion in one day, was impracticable; the confining Preaching to Kirks, hinders Miniſters from Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſeveral other parts of their Paroches, where
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:40126:197"/> Preaching is ſometimes very requiſite upon week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, and renders the Celebration of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in ſome places impracticable, when People will not go out from the Tables except there be Preaching without, and they were burdenſome, and hindred Miniſters from making full proof of their Miniſtry, in being an occaſion of ſtumbling, to People, who not knowing how to diſtinguiſh, betwixt the Indulgence, which was a permiſſion to Preach, and theſe impoſitions, nor knowing how to put a difference betwixt preſcribing of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and accepting of them, did take up prejudices, firſt againſt theſe Miniſters, and then againſt their Miniſtry and the Ordinances diſpenſed by them, and ſome of them went that length, to make it their work, to render theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and their Miniſtry contemptible, and to count it Service to God, to deſpiſe his Servants, and to hinder the work of their Miniſtry: And if the very preſcribing of theſe Rules, had ſuch effects, what would the acceptance and obſervance of them have done? Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. words uttered before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, excludes all the Magiſtrates impoſitions, upon Miniſters, in the matters of their Miniſtry, and ſo excludes theſe Inſtructions, which were impoſitions of that nature; and all impoſitions of that nature, even the confinement, is comprehended, which did reſtrain the exerciſe of their Miniſtry, and tended to hinder them from making full proof of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry: The denying to the Magiſtrate a formal Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Power, excludes the Magiſtrate from all Acts, which are the formal exerciſe of Eccleſiaſtick Functions, and ſo from making Eccleſiaſtical
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:40126:198"/> Canons, or Rules, formally Eccleſiaſtical. Again, in aſſerting, that Rules intrinſically Eccleſiaſtical, given by the Magiſtrate, are impoſitions, he ſhews, that the Magiſtrate hath not a warrantable Power, to make, and impoſe ſuch Rules upon Miniſters. And in aſſerting, that they were the Servants of Chriſt, in the matters of their Miniſtry, he did ſhew that they could not be ruled by the Magiſtrates will or pleaſure, in theſe matters; but behoved to be ruled by his will, whoſe Miniſters they were; and that therefore they could not accept of and receive any Rules of the Magiſtrates making, or impoſing, which would either hinder or marr their Maſters Service; and the acceptance of which, would any way hinder them from making full proof of their Miniſtry, or marr them in doing theſe matters, in which they were not the Magiſtrates Servants, but Chriſts. Theſe things are imported clearly in, or clearly follow from Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. words, and they do manifeſtly exclude all encroachments of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate upon the calling of the Miniſtry, and its exerciſe, and ſo explains and confirms Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. words, in their genuine ſenſe. He goes on: <hi>If he meant</hi> (ſaith the Hiſtorian) <hi>the ſame Rules,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then he confirms Mr.</hi> Blairs <hi>Argument. Anſw.</hi> So he does; he both clears what he ſaid, and confirms it: He clears, in ſhewing that the Rules, which they and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> could not receive, were Rules made and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Magiſtrate, for Regulating Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick Canons, Rules intrinſically Eccleſiaſtical of the Magiſtrates making, and the enjoyning of which to Miniſters, was an impoſition. And beſides Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. words do more clearly obviate exceptions and
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:40126:198"/> objections, than Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. do (though Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. words, taken in their genuine and native ſenſe, and the ſenſe which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> took them in, and be not wreſted, are clear enough. For Inſtructions and Inſtructions to Regulate and to Regulate Miniſters in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry, ſounds at the firſt hearing to all, who have but common ſenſe of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that nature, Eccleſiaſtical Canons, or Canons formally and intrinſically Eccleſiaſtical, which the Magiſtrate ſhould not form and impoſe.) For if any ſhould Object. 1. May not the Magiſtrate (according to what is ſaid in the firſt Chap. of the ſecond Book of Diſcipline) command Miniſters to Preach, Baptize, Exerciſe Diſcipline, according to the Rule of the Word of God? <hi>Anſw.</hi> No doubt, but the Rule of the Word of God, is not a Rule of the Magiſtrates making, and his enjoyning Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to obſerve the Rule of the Word, in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Miniſtry is no impoſition upon them, nor does that command of the Magiſtrate any way hinder, but further the Service of Chriſt. <hi>Object. May not the Magiſtrate enjoyn Miniſters to obſerve the Acts of a Synod, which he hath ratified by his Civil Sanction? Anſw.</hi> Theſe Canons or Acts, are not formed by the Magiſtrate, but by the Synod. Obj. <hi>May not the Magiſtrate form Acts of the ſame nature with theſe, that general Aſſemblies and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods form, for Regulating Miniſters in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry? Anſw.</hi> That were to confound the Office of the Magiſtrate with the Office of the Miniſter, and to bring the Magiſtrate in upon the calling of the Miniſtry, to elicite and exerce Acts which are intrinſically Eccleſiaſtical: It belongs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſically
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:40126:199"/> to the Office of Miniſters of the Church, to explain and apply the Word of God, and theſe Eccleſiaſtick Rules, muſt be drawn from the Word of God; the forming of ſuch Canons, hath in all Ages, been looked upon, as the work of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Synods, who had no Power of the Sword, and therefore that work is the exerciſe of the Spiritual Keys, and not of the Civil Sword. As the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Rules of Phyſick, and forming Medicinal Receipts, is intrinſical to the faculty of Phyſick; ſo is the forming of Eccleſiaſtick Canons, intrinſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal to the calling of the Miniſtry. Obj. <hi>May not the Magiſtrate interrupt the Preaching, though on the Sabbath, when an Enemy is coming to Aſſault the Town, and call the People from the Church, to the Walls of the City to defend it. Anſw.</hi> That is no burdenſome impoſition upon the Miniſter, in the exerciſe of his Miniſtry, it's a work of Neceſſity, and the Lord declares his mind, that in ſuch caſes he will have mercy and not ſacrifice. Obj. <hi>May not the Magiſtrate make a general Muſter through all his Dominions in one day of the week, and diſcharge Publick Sermon upon that day? Anſw.</hi> That is no impoſition prejudging the Service of Chriſt, for Miniſters may Preach, as conveniently, and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more conveniently, upon any other day of the week.</p>
               <p>It pertains to the Magiſtrate to make Laws and Conſtitutions, for the advancement of the Kirk, and Policy thereof, without Uſurping any thing that pertains not to the Civil Sword, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. <hi>Book of Diſcip. Chap.</hi> 10. cited, if I remember before, the Magiſtrate ſhould make Laws for advancement
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:40126:199"/> of Church-Policy, but not for its detriment; his Power about Church matters is cumulative not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive: And if he ſhould not make Civil Laws, prejudicial to the Policy of the Church, far leſs ſhould he make Eccleſiaſtick Canons, and Canons that would be hurtful, though they were formed by a Church Judicatory; for here there are two faults: 1. Taking on him to do, what belongs to Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick Courts. 2. Making Rules which upon the matter, hinders Miniſters from making full proof of their Miniſtry. In his 2. he quarrels at the terms, intrinſically and formally, as general and not obviouſly intelligible, nor underſtood by every one. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe are terms ordinarily made uſe of by Orthodox Divines in matters of this nature: They are ſpecial and ſpecifick terms, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Eccleſiaſtick Rules from theſe Civil Laws and Conſtitutions, which are intrinſically and formally Civil, but are extrinſically and objectively conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant about Eccleſiaſtick matters. Now we heard from the 10 <hi>Chap.</hi> of the 2d. <hi>Book of Diſcipline,</hi> that it pertains to the Magiſtrate to make Laws and Conſtitutions, according to the Word of God, for advancement of the Kirk and Policy thereof. What he ſays in the end of <hi>pag.</hi> 74. about the Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Confinement of a Miniſters Perſon, that it is wholly Political, and no more Eccleſiaſtical than any other thing which concerns a Miniſters Perſon, as his Hat, Books and Clothes, and the like. This ſhews, that the Miniſters, who ſimply refuſed to receive Rules and Inſtructions formally and intrinſically Eccleſiaſtical, and diſtinguiſhed theſe from ſuch Political Acts, as the Confinement,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:40126:200"/> in refuſing of which they were not ſo peremptory, but would obſerve or not obſerve them, as they judged of them, in their Conſcience upon their peril, did in this Act very rationally. That Hats, Clothes and Books, do immediately concern a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters Perſon, are terms not obviouſly intelligible, every one doth not underſtand, how theſe do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately concern a Miniſters Perſon; he who would have others ſpeak, as every one may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, ſhould have ſpoken more plainly, to make Miniſters Clothes wholly Political, without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, was a little kittle; but it's like he hath not had mind of Surplices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when he wrote this. He adds, <hi>Or will Rules made concerning the length of time which a Miniſter is to ſpend in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of this or that Act of his Miniſtry, or the like, be accounted Rules extrinſically and materially Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick; as to ſuch Rules,</hi> he ſays, <hi>pag.</hi> 75. <hi>It is a Queſtion, if Magiſtrates may either ſolely, or</hi> in prima inſtantia, <hi>preſcribe ſuch Rules to Miniſters, however this being at beſt but dubious — and it (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me at leaſt) very uncertain, what Rules theſe are, which may be called externally and materially Eccleſiaſtical, I could have wiſhed, that ſome inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces hereof had been given,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If he would have dealt fairly, he ſhould have uſed the ordinary terms, and not made terms of his own, for Rules <hi>formally</hi> and <hi>intrinſically</hi> Eccleſiaſtical, are diſtinguiſhed from Civil Laws and Conſtitutions, <hi>objectively</hi> and <hi>extrinſically</hi> Eccleſiaſtical: And i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> his calling them Rules <hi>externally</hi> and <hi>materially</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, is a miſcalling of them, that he may make a knot in a Ruſh, where he finds none. 2. If
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:40126:200"/> an Indulged Miniſter had made a Queſtion, if the Magiſtrate might limit the length of time which a Miniſter is to ſpend in the exerciſe of this or that Act of his Miniſtry, and had but doubted of it as a thing dubious, it's very probable that the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian would have made this no leſs than a betraying of the Cauſe: He makes hideous outcries againſt them, upon as little ground. But ſeeing he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf grants that ſome of the Inſtructions, given by the Magiſtrate, were <hi>formally</hi> and <hi>intrinſically</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, <hi>pag.</hi> 65. He is as much obliged as the Indulged Miniſters, to ſhew what are the Rules, which are contra-diſtinguiſhed from theſe, they might be clear with him that ſome of theſe Rules were ſuch, and why might it not be Lawful for them, as well as for him to doubt, concerning others of them. The Brother who hath anſwered this Hiſtory, — ſhews, that the paper in which theſe Miniſters agreed, would have informed him; and if he had been ſo deſirous to know, he might have ſent for it for his Inſtruction. But not to go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the inſtance which he brings. If the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate make an Act, if there be Sermon in a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon a Market-day, that the Congregation ſhall be diſmiſſed againſt ſuch an hour, here is an Act extrinſically regulating or limiting the exerciſe of the Publick Worſhip; and if the time preceding that hour be a time of the day at which it is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for the People to meet, I ſee no cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining or claſhing with the Magiſtrate in that matter. But if the Magiſtrate ſhould take upon him, to preſcribe to the Miniſter how he ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain his Text, and in what method he ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:40126:201"/> his Doctrines, that would be an intrenching upon the Calling of the Miniſtry; there are ſome things which are intrinſical to every Calling and Art, and Rules for ordering theſe, are to be drawn from the Principles of that Art and Calling; and the forming of theſe Rules, is the <hi>formal</hi> and <hi>intrinſick</hi> exerciſe of that Calling, and Art. And there are ſome Circumſtantials that are ſo extrinſick, that they make no moral alteration upon an Action, but it may be every way as well done, and to as good purpoſe, with one of theſe Circumſtances as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: As for example, whether the Sermon in a City ſhall begin upon the week-day, at eight hours, or half nine; and if there be two Kirks alike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, for the Congregation to meet in, it's all one, as to the morality of the meeting, whether it be here or there: And in ſuch circumſtantials as theſe, if the Magiſtrates Acts do not prejudge, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede, or marr, the exerciſe of the Miniſtry, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have no Reaſon to complain, that ſuch Acts intrenches and incroaches upon the exerciſe of their Miniſtry, or marrs them in the managing of theſe matters, in which they are the Servants of Chriſt. Seeing the Hiſtorian was ſo deſirous to have this matter cleared, and thinks it is not cleared, by what theſe Miniſters ſaid, why would he not endeavour to Reſolve this Queſtion? And ſeeing he looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe Miniſters, at leaſt ſome of the ableſt of them, as pedants, after he had removed them off the Field, and left it fair for himſelf, why would he not Triumph and glory over them, in teaching theſe pedants, and doing that alone, which they all
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:40126:201" rendition="simple:additions"/> could not do? and ſo Reign alone as the Baſilisk doth, according to the Verſe,
<q>
                     <l>— Late ſibi ſubmovet omne,</l>
                     <l>Vulgus, ut in vacua regnet Baſiliſcus arena.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But he is ſo far from being reſolute here, from coming forward, as a Doctor <hi>Reſolutus,</hi> that he ſneaks away, <hi>inter doctores dubitantes;</hi> and yet I have no doubt that he could have ſaid ſomething to it, if he had liked; but his buſineſs there was not to ſtinguiſh, reſolve, and clear confuſed, perplexed, dark things: but to render things, which were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and clearly reſolved, confuſed, dark, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed. And, I ſuppoſe, this Hiſtory is one of the moſt confuſed, and to ignorant people one of the moſt confounding Books that ever was written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on matters of this nature. And I think upon tryal, it will be found, that one may learn more ſolid know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the matters which this Author treats of, in reading a few lines of the confeſſion of Faith, or of the ſecond Book of Diſcipline, or of the courſe of Conformity, where theſe matters are handled, than from all that this Author hath written in 162 pages.</p>
               <p>I come next to what he ſays, <hi>pag.</hi> 75. §. 2. to the other part of Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. Diſcourſe, which was, <hi>But for the Magiſtrates Power objectively Eccleſiaſtical, whereby they might judge of matters of Religion, in order to their own Act, whether they would approve or diſcountenance ſuch a way, he knew no Reformed Divine that did deny it unto them, and therefore deſired, that his Brother Mr.</hi> A. B. <hi>might not be
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:40126:202"/> miſtaken. The other part of the Diſcourſe,</hi> ſaith the Hiſtorian, <hi>is as uſeleſs, for any thing I can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, for clearing of Mr.</hi> B. <hi>or his Diſcourſe. Anſw.</hi> Some ill humours does vitiate and diſ-enable ſome mens eyes, and their perceptive faculties, that they cannot ſee nor perceive what is very viſible and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible. 2. Though this part of the Diſcourſe did not clear Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. Diſcourſe, yet it did compleat it, and ſo was not uſeleſs; yea, what compleats a Diſcourſe which was defective, doth alſo clear it, as two lights joyned do enlighten one another, and the whole compounded of both, is more luminous. So truths which have connexion one with another, being joyned together, clear one another; he might have remembred, that ſome ſubjects of Diſcourſe cannot be ſufficiently cleared, except they be treated of, both affirmatively and negatively, and he who ſpeaks both affirmatively and negatively of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates Power, ſpeaks more clearly than he who ſpeaks onely negatively: And he who not only ſhews what Power the Magiſtrate hath not in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, but alſo what Power he hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout theſe matters, ſpeaks more clearly, than he who ſheweth only what Power the Magiſtrate hath not, but ſaith nothing of what Power he hath in theſe matters. And there was the more need of this, in the matter in hand, becauſe of the queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Magiſtrates and Miniſters, of the bounds of their Power. And as theſe queſtions of marches are very kittle, becauſe of Intereſt, ſo the ridding of marches, in the matter of Power and Authority are moſt tickliſh; for Authority is a very tender thing, and it's ſcarcely to be expected, that any Perſon in
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:40126:202"/> Power, will not be diſpleaſed with one, who ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that matter, tells onely what he may not do, but never ſpeaks a word of what he may do. And therefore Mr. <hi>H.</hi> perceiving my L. Chancellour diſpleaſed with Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and having a clear ground to conceive that this was at leaſt one thing that the Chancellour was diſpleaſed with, that Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> ſeemed not to allow to the Magiſtrate what did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him, which manifeſtly appears by my L. Chancellours queſtioning him, if the Council might confine him? To which Queſtion Mr. <hi>B.</hi> anſwered, that he did not deny that the Council might confine him. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> I ſay, perceiving this, did very ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably ſtep in, to remove my L. Chancellours mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of and diſpleaſure againſt Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſhewing, that though they could not allow to the Magiſtrate a Power to make and impoſe Inſtructions <hi>intrinſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> Eccleſiaſtical, yet all Orthodox Divines, and conſequently Mr. <hi>Blair,</hi> was ſo far from denying to the Magiſtrate a power of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which is an Act, both formally and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively Civil, that they granted to the Magiſtrate a Civil Power which was objectively Eccleſiaſtical, &amp; therefore deſired that his Brother Mr. <hi>A.B.</hi> might not be miſtaken, as if he denied this, which all Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Divines grant; and, as what Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſpoke, was right and very full, as to the matter in hand, ſo it was very appoſite, for ſhewing what was Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. mind in theſe matters, and to remove miſtakes; and thus we ſee that the Hiſtorian is much miſtaken when he takes up Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. words, as uſeleſs for clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> or of his Diſcourſe; for he clears Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to be of the ſame judgment with all Orthodox
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:40126:203"/> Divines, as to the Magiſtrates Power objectively Eccleſiaſtical; and this part of Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. Diſcourſe, added to Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. aſſertion, as it was explained by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> by adding the terms agreed upon in the meeting, did give much light for clearing the ſenſe of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. words. Let us hear the Hiſtorians Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to prove the uſeleſneſs of Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. words. 1. Saith he, <hi>There was nothing in Mr.</hi> B's. <hi>Diſcourſe, giving the leaſt hint of his denying that Power to the Magiſtrate, which all Orthodox Anti-eraſtian Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines grant. Anſw.</hi> That's true; but it is as true, that there is nothing in Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. Diſcourſe, giving the leaſt hint of his giving this power which is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all Orthodox Divines to the Magiſtrate. 2. It's clear enough that my L. Chancellour hath taken Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. words as a denyal that the Magiſtrate had any Power over Miniſters, which appears by his Lordſhips queſtion to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> if the Council might confine him? Nor 2. Saith the Hiſtorian, <hi>doth this piece of the Diſcourſe, in any manner of way, clear in what ſenſe Magiſtrates may give Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Miniſters to Regulate them in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry. Anſw.</hi> That's true; but it clears, that though Magiſtrates may not make Inſtructions <hi>formally</hi> and <hi>intrinſically</hi> Eccleſiaſtical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet they might make Civil Laws and Conſtitutions, which have Miniſters and their Miniſtry for their Object, and ſo are objectively converſant about Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal matters, about Miniſters and the exerciſe of their Miniſtry. He adds, <hi>That he cannot imagine to what purpoſe this Diſcourſe was brought in, or what it was that gave the leaſt occaſion thereto. Anſw.</hi> This is very ſtrange, for the Author had an imagination
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:40126:203"/> that was pretty fertile in other matters, and pretty ſagacious, to find out the purpoſe of the Diſcourſes of the Adverſaries, whoſe Writings he examined. And the purpoſe of this Diſcourſe was ſo obvious, 1. From the Objections of the Adverſaries of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, which alledge that they give too little to the Magiſtrate; and ſome of them are not aſhamed to calumniate Presbyterians as if they gave as little to the Magiſtrate as Papiſts do. 2. From the touchy ſenſe that all in Authority have of any thing that diminiſhes, or but ſeems to diminiſh their Power, or to derogate from it. 3. From my L. Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours diſpleaſure at Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and his queſtion propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed about the Magiſtrates Power of confining, and Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. beginning and ending his Diſcourſe with that deſire, that their Lordſhips would not miſtake Mr. <hi>B.</hi> That it's a wonder how a Perſon that had any imagination at all, could miſs the purpoſe of this Diſcourſe: But yet all theſe objective Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which might have as Guides led his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the true deſign of Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. Diſcourſe, were overſwayed by two more intimate Guides, which, like ill Ghoſts, haunted his imagination in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters relating to Indulged Miniſters, I mean his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Prejudice, which habitually miſ-guided him in theſe matters, and led him out of the right way, which was obvious, into extravagant phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſms and imaginations, which are ſo wild, that it's a wonder how any man who had but common ſenſe to rectifie his imagination, could give way let be with-gate to them, or how he could ſuffer them to ariſe; or if they had ſtarted when he was not adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, how he could behold them without laughter
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:40126:204"/> or indignation, but that he ſhould have entertained them, and bewildered himſelf and his followers in following them, is one of the wildeſt Wild-gooſe Chaſes imaginable. There is one thing ſomewhat ſingular in this Authors imagination in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that his imagination hath a habitual miſhap of miſſing the right way, and taking the wrong. I do not remember of any Perſon to whom I can compare him in this, except one, who was a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to a Gentleman of my Acquaintance, of whom I heard his Maſter ſay, that when his Servant took the guiding of the way, he conſtantly miſtook; when he came where there were two ways, he was ſure to take the wrong way: which his Maſter ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving often obſerved, he reſolved when there was any doubt of the way, never to take the way which his man took, but the way which he left, and ſo he was ſure not to be miſtaken. But yet I muſt give the Hiſtorian the pre-eminence in wandring, for that Servant took but one wrong way at once, but the Hiſtorian, when he hath proſecuted one wrong imaginary way, in which no foot hath trod before him, and followed it out, till he could win no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he immediately comes back, and at the ſame paſs where he began to wander he takes another wrong way, and then another, and ſo forth, till he hath wearied himſelf and his followers to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and which is yet worſe, after all theſe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings, he never comes right. That Servant I ſpoke of came back to his Maſter to the right way, but the Author having no other Guide but his own imagination, miſcarried by Prejudice and Paſſion, wanders habitually when he begins to gueſs at the
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:40126:204"/> Indulged Miniſters meaning; and upon a falſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, that they meant ſomething which never came in their head, he purſues after them in a way which they never took nor dreamed of; and then to be ſure to overtake them ſome way, he begins again, if they meant not that, they meant this; and then again purſues, and ſo faſhes himſelf in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own fancies, but for the true meaning of theſe Miniſters, he ordinarily miſſes it, though it be moſt obvious to any who will not hood-wink him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Any who looks but with half an eye into this Controverſie about the limits of the Magiſtrates and Miniſters Power, and into this buſineſs which was before the Council, will ſee that it was moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to add what Mr. <hi>H.</hi> added to Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. words, both for clearing Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. meaning, and for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the Objections that the Magiſtrate or others for the Magiſtrate might make againſt an Aſſertion which ſeemed to exclude the Magiſtrate from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any Power about Church Canons, or the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the Miniſtry; to which there was nothing added to clear what Power the Magiſtrate had in reference to matters of Religion. Might they not have Objected, Ye will, we ſee, take no Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from Magiſtrates, nor commands to Regulate the exerciſe of your Miniſtry: Ye will make Rules your ſelves for Regulating your Miniſtry, but ye will admit us to make none, for any thing we hear from you? Ye aſcribe no Power to us about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion: What, can the Magiſtrate do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the Reformation and preſervation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and for Reforming Miniſters? Is the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate bound up, that he cannot hinder the making
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:40126:205"/> or execution of wrong Canons? What if a Church-Aſſembly, a Council agree upon <hi>Arrianiſm,</hi> and reſolve to Preach this to the Magiſtrates Subjects? What if they make Canons for Idolatry, for ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Images, as the 2d. <hi>Nicen</hi> Council did? What if they agree to publiſh the error of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, and to lift up the Bread in the Euchariſt to be adored by the People? What if they agree upon a Church-policy manifeſtly contrary to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and require the Subjects to ſubject themſelves to be ruled by theſe Rules of Policy of their own making? Shall the Magiſtrate ſuffer his Subjects to be poiſoned with Hereſie, Idolatry, corrupt Church-mens Tyranny? Can he do nothing to hinder the making of ſuch Heretical, Idolatrous, Tyrannical Canons, or to cruſh them, and hinder the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them when they are made? Muſt he blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſent to all the Canons Kirk-men enact, and add his Civil Sanction to them, and ſee to the execution of them, that is to promove the eternal deſtruction of his own Subjects? Does not the confeſſion of Faith allow to the Magiſtrate a Power for Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and conſervation of Religion? And our lateſt Confeſſion of Faith, though it aſſert, <hi>Chap.</hi> 31. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. That it belongs to Synods and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils Miniſterially to determine Controverſies of Faith, and Caſes of Conſcience, to ſet down Rules and Directions for the better Ordering of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip of God, and Government of his Church, to receive complaints in caſes of male Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, and Authoritatively determine the ſame; yet it doth not aſſert, that though theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees be contrary to the Word of God, that they
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:40126:205"/> are to be received by any, and much leſs by the Magiſtrate; for it's added in that ſame Article, <hi>Which Decrees and Determinations, if conſonant to the Word of God, are to be received with Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Submiſſion, not only for their agreement to the Word, but alſo for the Power whereby they are made, as being an Ordinance of God appointed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in his Word.</hi> And though that ſame late Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſſion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 23. <hi>Article</hi> 3. affirm, that the Civil Magiſtrate may not aſſume to himſelf the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Word and Sacraments, or the power of the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, yet he hath Authority, and it is his Duty to take Order, that Unity and Peace be preſerved in the Church, that the truth of God be kept pure and entire; that all Blaſphemies and Hereſies be ſuppreſſed, all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and abuſes in Worſhip and Diſcipline pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented or Reformed, and all Ordinances of God duly ſettled, adminiſtred, and obſerved; for the better effecting whereof, he hath Power to call Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, to be preſent at them, and to provide that whatſoever is tranſacted in them, be according to the mind of God: Thus might they ſay, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith acknowledges that the Magiſtrate hath Authority for doing much in reference to the Reformation and preſervation of Religion, but we hear nothing from you of any Power the Magiſtrate hath in reference to matters of Religion; ye onely tell what the Magiſtrate may not do in reference to you, and the exerciſe of your Miniſtry, and is this all the reſpect ye have to Authority? Now this and much more would have been Objected; and had not Mr. <hi>H.</hi> then very good reaſon to add this
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:40126:206"/> ſecond part of his Diſcourſe? The Learned and Judicious Author or Authors of the Courſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity ſaw it neceſſary after they had ſhewed what the Magiſtrate might not do in matters of Religion, to ſubjoyn a Diſcourſe ſhewing what they might do; and becauſe the Book is not common, I ſhall tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ſomewhat to this purpoſe. Page 147, 148, 149. ye will ſee how tender they are in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God, and how reſpectful alſo to Lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; they ſhew, <hi>pag.</hi> 147. that no man may command what he will, in any controverted mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Eccleſiaſtical. And then they relate this Hiſtory, When <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great came to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he deſired his Image to be erected in the Temple: The High Prieſt was willing to pleaſe him in any thing, wherein God was not diſpleaſed; and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing with all Reverence that Idolatry, what he might, and what ſerved more for the Kings Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, he offered chearfully; firſt to begin the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their times from his entry into <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and 2. To name all their firſt-born Sons <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> from him. Then they add, What is Civil, what is Domeſtick, what is <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, what is ours, let them be forbidden Water and Fire, and their City ſown with ſalt, who refuſe it; let Chriſts Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Prerogative, who will not give his Glory to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, be kept for himſelf: May we not in ſo narrow a ſtrait, where we can ſee no way to turn, neither to the right hand nor to the left, open our mouths with the Obedient Aſſe? Have we uſed to ſerve ſo in other matters? Then they cite <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> who ſhews, that if a Miniſter teach or adminiſter the Sacraments againſt the Word of God, he is to
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:40126:206"/> be repreſſed by the Civil Magiſtrate, and yet not from him, but from the Word of God ſhall he ſeek the Rules and Reaſons of his Function. And then they cite <hi>Franciſcus Junius</hi> ſaying, 1. <hi>By what Authority or example is the Magiſtrate moved to think that the holy Kirk of God, and the ſimplicity of the Myſteries of Chriſt (whoſe voice alone his ſheep know and follow, becauſe the Father command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it ſhould be heard onely.</hi> John 10.27.) <hi>ſhould be clothed about with humane Traditions.</hi> 2. <hi>To what end, thinketh he, muſt his things be ſowed unto the Ordinances of God; for if it be that ſhe may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to others, it were more equitable that other Kirks ſhould conform to them, who come neareſt to the Word of God, according to</hi> Cyprian's <hi>Counſel; not that they ſhould joyn themſelves to other Kirks: If it be that all things may be more decent, what can be more decent, than the ſimplicity of Chriſt? What more ſimple than his decency? If it be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his own will, let it be ſo; but it muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred that the Will of God is the greateſt neceſſity, and that the Kirk of God, in things Divine, is not ſubject to the will of Men, and what events may follow upon humane Traditions, as daily experience hath ſhewed.</hi> Then <hi>Archippus</hi> excepts, ſaying, <hi>You ever tell me what he ſhould not do, but I would hear ſomething poſitive of his Power in things Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, what he ſhould, and may do in times of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention eſpecially. Epaphras</hi> Anſwereth, <hi>That is not my part, ye know, yet this I may ſay, that as in the matter of Hereſie, ſo in the time of Schiſm, for matters of Ceremony, the Magiſtrate calleth a Synod, repreſenting the whole Kirk, having Power
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:40126:207"/> definitive, and the judgment of Juriſdiction accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Word, right as naturally in the Soul of Man, to make it plain by a compariſon, the Imperial power of the Will, may command the underſtanding,</hi> quoad exercitium, <hi>that is, to pauſe upon a certain purpoſe, and to give her determination, but not</hi> quoad ſpecificationem, <hi>that is, to aſſent or diſſent, or to determine to the one ſide more than to the other; and as the ſame will hath</hi> actum elicitum, <hi>as her eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, and moſt proper operation; and</hi> actum impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratum, <hi>produced by another power of the Soul at the commandment of the Will, as the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ponder and conſider, the Appetite to exerciſe Temperance, Fortitude,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and out of her deſire and choice of the Soveraign good of the Soul and Body, ſetteth all the Powers of Soul and Body to work; even ſo the Magiſtrate hath,</hi> actum elicitum, <hi>in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Affairs, his eſſential and moſt proper Object. In the matters of Gods Kirk, whether for Order or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, albeit he hath not</hi> actum elicitum, <hi>he may neither Preach the Word, nor miniſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor define by himſelf regularly; yet he hath</hi> actum imperatum, <hi>he may command Miniſters to Preach the Word, to Celebrate the Sacraments, and to Convene and determine according to the Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Archip. <hi>And ſay you no more, is that all?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Epaphras. <hi>And more than this, he hath in all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Canons or concluſions a three-fold judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: One common, as a Chriſtian; another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as a Magiſtrate; the third Perſonal, as a man ſingularly gifted. As a Chriſtian, the judgment of Diſcretion, that he believe not or practice any thing of all that which the Kirk concludeth, if he find it
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:40126:207"/> to be againſt the Word. As a Magiſtrate, he muſt have the judgment of his Vocation to diſcern what concerneth the Spiritual weal and Salvation of his Subjects, and accordingly to add, or ſuſpend the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And as a ſingular Magiſtrate, having more than ordinary gifts of Knowledge and Piety, he ought to have ſuch Intereſt in Determination and Juriſdiction with the Kirk as others who have more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary gifts.</hi> Thus we ſee theſe Godly Learned Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſaw it neceſſary to ſhew, not only what Power the Magiſtrate had not, but alſo poſitively what Power he had in things Eccleſiaſtical; and Divines generally who treat of theſe matters uſe to do ſo for preventing miſtakes in ſo tickliſh a matter. And therefore <hi>Mr. H.</hi> did as became a Godly, Learned, and Wiſe man, and a man who had a tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Lawful Authority, and that from a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Conſcience. He ſpeaks againſt all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates impoſitions which burdened their Miniſtry; he ſpoke againſt a Power formally Eccleſiaſtical in the Magiſtrate, againſt the Magiſtrates exerciſing this Power in forming Inſtructions intrinſically Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, for Regulating Miniſters in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry, that the matters of their Miniſtry were Chriſts matters, and ſo not at the Magiſtrates Arbitrary diſpoſal, nor at the Miniſters diſpoſal ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they being but Servants in theſe matters. And as he denies to the Magiſtrate that Miniſterial Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which Chriſt hath given to his Servants, ſo he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes to the Magiſtrate that Magiſtratical Power which God hath given them; and ſo obviates the Objections and Exceptions formerly mentioned: For the Magiſtrates Power about Religion is ſummarily
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:40126:208"/> comprehended in theſe words, the Magiſtrates Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er objectively Eccleſiaſtical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he ſhews, that the Magiſtrate is not, as Papiſts ſay, obliged blindly to execute the Eccleſiaſtick Sentences of Church-men, but hath the judgment of his Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby he may judge whether he will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove or diſcountenance their Canons or Sentences, or any way or courſe that they take.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> (ſaith the Hiſtorian) <hi>as to the main buſineſs, I would further enquire whether the Brethren do judge the matter of giving theſe Inſtructions, about which the Debate did ariſe, did belong to the firſt part of the Diſcourſe, and ſo to be intrinſically and formally Eccleſiaſtical; or to the latter part, and ſo belong to that power of the Magiſtrate which is objectively Eccleſiaſtical: This Queſtion muſt be judged neceſſary, unleſs that whole Diſcourſe be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted unneceſſary and impertinent. Anſw.</hi> 1. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever come of his queſtion, the neceſſity and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of the whole of <hi>Mr. H</hi>'s. Diſcourſe, is already cleared to any who will not ſhut their eyes againſt the light. 2. There is one of theſe Inſtructions by his own conſeſſion wholly Political, <hi>viz.</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement; and therefore it is neither formally not objectively Eccleſiaſtical (and yet it was ſpoken againſt by <hi>Mr. H.</hi> in his firſt Speech, it being a burdenſom impoſition in the matter of the Miniſtry) and ſo his queſtion is not comprehenſive enough, and if it be reſolved into a disjunctive Aſſertion, it's by his own grant falſe. 3. If he apprehend that all theſe Inſtructions muſt either wholly belong to the firſt part of the Diſcourſe, or all of them onely to the ſecond part, the propoſition is not neceſſary,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:40126:208"/> for ſome of them may belong to the firſt, and ſome to the ſecond part of the Diſcourſe, and yet all of them be burdenſome impoſitions. <hi>If the former be ſaid</hi> (ſaith the Hiſtorian) <hi>then why was any troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at Mr.</hi> B's. <hi>refuſing the Inſtructions? Anſw.</hi> None was troubled for his refuſing theſe Inſtructions, for they all agreed not to receive them. <hi>Why</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>were not theſe condemned who had received them? Anſw.</hi> There were none who received them; if he think that the taking of them in their hand, was a receiving of them or accepting of them, this is one of his falſe imaginations: Will any ſay that a man who is unjuſtly Baniſhed, or Condemned to die, does approve of the Sentence as right, becauſe he takes it in his hand? The Author himſelf does not condemn but commend <hi>Mr. B.</hi> and yet he took them in his hand. He adds, <hi>Why did not ſuch as had received them caſt them back again? Anſw.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that would have been ill manners; the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is none of the beſt of Hiſtorians, and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive he would be no good Maſter of manners; the caſting of papers at Magiſtrates is no good caſt of that craft; if he had adviſed them to lay them down civilly, with all reſpect to Authority, there would have been ſomething of Civility here: But to caſt papers at any Magiſtrate, let be at the Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours, is an ugly rudeneſs, that I ſuppoſe hath not been heard of where there hath been any ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Civility. Though the Magiſtrate had caſt theſe papers at them, it would have been ill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to have caſt them back; but when the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate very civilly delivered them to the Miniſters, if the Miniſters had caſt them back to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:40126:209"/> it would not onely have argued unmanner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and abſurd rudeneſs, but a manifeſt contempt of Authority. I think the Author did not caſt back his Act of Baniſhment at the Magiſtrate: Some have better manners when they are before the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates face, than when they are behind their back. But they who from a principle of Conſcience ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Magiſtrates, will neither contemn them before their face, nor behind their back. Although this caſting back the Magiſtrates papers was ill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, yet it may be he thought it good Policy, that though it was Morally ill, it was Politically good, as <hi>Ahithophel</hi>'s Counſel was, and that it was ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the grand Deſign of the new Policy, which hath broken out lately in the late bond and <hi>Sanchar</hi> Declaration; for this caſting back the Magiſtrates Papers would have been a mean pretty fit to have made an outcaſt betwixt Magiſtrates and Miniſters, and a ſtep to the caſting off the Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>He adds another Queſtion. <hi>How came it,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that all of them did not unanimouſly agree in this Teſtimony? Anſw.</hi> In what Teſtimony? That all theſe Inſtructions were formally and intrinſically Eccleſiaſtick Rules? But this, even in the Opinion of the Hiſtorian, had been to agree in a falſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; for he ſays, that one of them was wholly Political. And <hi>pag.</hi> 65. he does not ſay, that all of them, but he ſuppoſes that ſome of them were indeed formally and intrinſically Eccleſiaſtical. Why, would he have had theſe Miniſters agreeing in a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, that he could not have agreed to himſelf? This is not fair, but falſe dealing, to quarrel with Miniſters becauſe they would not agree in a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:40126:209"/> and in a Teſtimony that he could not have given himſelf. He adds, <hi>Or how came it that their common mouth did not ſpeak what was the common Opinion of all. Anſw.</hi> Their common mouth ſpoke the Opinion of all, when he called all theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions impoſitions burdening them in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their Miniſtry. He ſpoke alſo the Opinion of all, when he ſaid, that they could not receive Canons intrinſically Eccleſiaſtick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from their Lordſhips. He ſpoke alſo the Opinion of all, when he ſaid, that though the Magiſtrate had not a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er formally Eccleſiaſtical, yet he had a Power ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively Eccleſiaſtical; and in theſe <hi>Mr. B.</hi> agreed with all the reſt. He adds, <hi>Why was it not more diſtinctly and in fewer words ſaid, that they could not receive theſe Inſtructions, as being Rules intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically and formally Eccleſiaſtical. Anſw.</hi> He himſelf grants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that all theſe Rules were not intrinſically and formally Eccleſiaſtical: And why would he have them diſtinctly in few words telling a lie, and that which he himſelf thought falſe? It's ſtrange that this Author hath ſuch an habit of erring, that he ſeldom miſſes to miſs the right way; it's yet more ſtrange, that he who is ſo habituate to wander, hath ſo great confidence in directing others: but it's ſtrangeſt of all, that he hath the confidence to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them to go in a way which he himſelf counts wrong, and hath told them that it is wrong; that he will needs have honeſt men teſtifie that before Rulers, which he himſelf hath declared to them that it's falſe; that he will have them to tell that, which, if he himſelf may be truſted, is a lie.</p>
               <p>The Hiſtorian goeth on. <hi>If the latter</hi> (ſaith
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:40126:210"/> he) <hi>be ſaid, then was not only Mr.</hi> B's. <hi>both Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and Diſcourſe condemned, but the whole Cauſe was baſely betrayed, becauſe under the pretext of the Magiſtrates Power Objectively Eccleſiaſtical, that, which is as intrinſically and formally Eccleſiaſtical as many other at leaſt are, was granted to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate: Will the Magiſtrates Power to act as a Man, and not as a Brute, in his Magiſtratical work about an Eccleſiaſtical Object, that is his Power to judge by the judgment of Diſcretion, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the Members of the Church; yea, to all men as men, which Papiſts deny unto Magiſtrates, allowing them onely to ſee with the Churches eyes, but Proteſtants grant unto them: Will this Power warrant them to give Inſtructions,</hi> &amp;c? <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Author having, according to his manner, miſtaken his way in miſtaking the manifeſt Deſign of <hi>Mr. H</hi>'s. ſecond ſpeech, in both the parts of it; the further he goes, the more he bewilders himſelf; they ſay, an Error in the firſt concoction, is not afterward rectified. <hi>Mr. H</hi>'s. deſign in that ſpeech was to ſhew, that though <hi>Mr. B.</hi> did not grant to the Magiſtrate a Power formally Eccleſiaſtical, to make Rules intrinſically Eccleſiaſtical, yet he did not deny to him a Power objectively Eccleſiaſtical; his wandring imagination, miſled with Prejudice and Paſſion, hath put him to all theſe blind gropings in his queries and ifs. I ſuppoſe the Indulged Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters have never ſaid, that all theſe Inſtructions were the exerciſe of the Magiſtrates objectively Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick Power, nor are they any way obliged to ſay it by any thing which <hi>Mr. H.</hi> ſaid for clearing <hi>Mr. B</hi>'s. meaning; but he would fain have them
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:40126:210"/> ſaying ſomething, that he might carp at it; and though they ſay it not, yet he ſays it, that he may have ſomething to ſay againſt his own idle ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions when he had nothing to ſay againſt <hi>Mr. H</hi>'s. true and pertinent poſitions. But ſuppoſe that ſome of theſe Brethren did think that ſome of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions were the exerciſe of the Civil Power ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively Eccleſiaſtical, as that firſt anent Marrying and Baptizing: I ſay, ſuppoſe that any of them thought that that Injunction could hardly be called formally and intrinſically Eccleſiaſtical, but object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ively onely, becauſe it is converſant about an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which had been in former times Eccleſiaſtically concluded in Lawful Church-Judicatories; yet the thinking or ſaying ſo, would not have been a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of <hi>Mr. B</hi>'s. Practice or Diſcourſe, for all of them agreed with <hi>Mr. Blair,</hi> in refuſing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the Magiſtrate Rules formally and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſically Eccleſiaſtical of the Magiſtrates making. Again, all of them agreed with <hi>Mr. Blair,</hi> that the Inſtructions which were at that time given by the Magiſtrate, were burdenſome impoſitions upon Miniſters, in the matters of their Miniſtry, which they could not approve: They looked upon the confinement which the Author counts wholly Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical, as a grievous impoſition: The Hiſtorian ſeems here to imagine that the acknowledging that the Magiſtrate hath a Power objectively Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, does oblige theſe who acknowledge it, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all his Injunctions which are objectively Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical; but this is another of his falſe imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for as the Kirk-Judicatories have often abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Power, which is formally Eccleſiaſtical, in
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:40126:211"/> making wrong Canons, as the 2d. Council of <hi>Nice</hi> did, in concluding the adoration of Images: So doth the Civil Magiſtrate often abuſe his Civil Power, which is objectively Eccleſiaſtical, in adding his Civil Sanction to, and enjoyning the Obſervance of ſinful Canons, Canons either in themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, or Canons, which though at the time which they were made were very convenient, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward through the change of the Conſtitution of Eccleſiaſtical Courts, and the alteration of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, becomes very inconvenient and prejudicial to the Church. So that though ſome of them had differed from others about the nature of ſome of theſe Inſtructions, whether they were the exerciſe of a Power formally Eccleſiaſtical, which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate ſhould not have aſſumed; or the exerciſe of a Civil Power objectively Eccleſiaſtical, but abuſed and miſapplyed: Yet ſeeing they all agreed in this, that they were burdenſome impoſitions, which they could not receive, and they were all agreed, that the Magiſtrate had not a Power formally Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical to form Canons intrinſically and formally Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical: They were far from condemning <hi>Mr. B</hi>'s. Practice or Diſcourſe, and much farther from betraying the Cauſe. The moſt that he could make of this would amount to no more than this, that ſome of theſe Brethren might be miſtaken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Nature of ſome of theſe Inſtructions in thinking they were not formally but objectively Eccleſiaſtical; and muſt honeſt men, who minded nothing but Honeſty, and who agreed together that theſe Inſtructions were bad, and not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, be charged with Treachery? Becauſe they
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:40126:211"/> were miſtaken in a Queſtion of that nature, which yet made no difference in their practice. But ſeeing he thinks that if any one of theſe Miniſters had judged that all theſe Inſtructions were objectively Eccleſiaſtical, that then he would have b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>trayed the Cauſe; I ſhall give to him, but not grant, that <hi>Mr. H.</hi> judged all theſe Inſtructions objectively Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, and not intrinſically Eccleſiaſtical: Yet he could not conclude that <hi>Mr. H.</hi> had baſely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed the whole Cauſe; for 1. Seeing <hi>Mr. H.</hi> did not declare this to be his judgment, he cannot be juſtly charged with betraying the whole, or betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any part of the Cauſe; for cauſes are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed by mens ſecret thoughts and judgings which they do not vent. The Author is very deſirous to have theſe Miniſters found treacherous, for when he can find no treachery in what they did, or ſaid, he enquires after their thoughts and ſecret judgment, and upon ſuppoſition that they judged thus or thus, as he ſuppoſes, though they never vented their judgment, concludes their treachery. 2. Though <hi>Mr. H.</hi> had thought all theſe Inſtructions objective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not formally Eccleſiaſtical, yet <hi>Mr. H.</hi> in granting to the Magiſtrate a Power objectively Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, could not be ſuppoſed to have granted to the Magiſtrate a Power to make theſe Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe <hi>Mr. H.</hi> had declared theſe Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be impoſitions, burdening Miniſters in the matter of their Miniſtry. Now the Power object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ively Eccleſiaſtical, which all Orthodox Divines, and <hi>Mr. H.</hi> with them, aſcribe to the Magiſtrate, is that Power which God hath given to them for good, to the Church it's cumulative, and not deſtructive;
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:40126:212"/> the King of Kings, by whom Kings Reign, hath not given to Kings a Power to impoſe upon his Miniſters impoſitions burdening them in the matter of their Miniſtry, and hindring and marring the work of the Miniſtry, in which they work the Work of the Lord, and are workers together with God. And thus, whether theſe Inſtructions were formally or objectively Eccleſiaſtical, ſeeing <hi>Mr. H.</hi> looked upon them as wrong, he can never be ſuppoſed to have granted to the Magiſtrate a Power objective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Eccleſiaſtical to enjoyn theſe Inſtructions, and therefore though this were ſuppoſed that <hi>Mr. H.</hi> had judged theſe Inſtructions to be objectively Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical, yet he could not be charged with betraying the Cauſe in granting to the Magiſtrate a Power objectively Eccleſiaſtical. Yet he will have them guilty of baſe Treachery, though he cannot prove it from any thing they did or ſaid, nor yet from any thought which he imagined they had about the nature of theſe Inſtructions, but the Reader may readily think, that it is not poſſible for him to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten the charge of betraying the whole Cauſe upon them, whoſe deeds, words, thoughts afford no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Treachery. Yet he will do it; the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der who hath obſerved the mans diſpoſition, will readily ſay, that he doubts nothing of his good will to render the Indulged Miniſters odious: But he thinks it impoſſible to him to prove out of <hi>Mr. H</hi>'s. words, that they baſely betrayed the whole Cauſe, ſeeing his words are the very words of Orthodox <hi>Anti-eraſtian</hi> Divines, when they ſpeak moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly of theſe matters. But it ſeems the Reader knows not the mans might, and where his ſtrength
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:40126:212"/> in this cauſe lies, when he thinks this impoſſible for him to faſten this guilt, this horrid guilt upon ſo many honeſt men: What talk you of impoſſibility? He not onely can do it, but he can do it very eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that by a maxime which paſſes currant without any contradiction, a maxime that this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor makes much uſe of in a miſter, and when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of invention fails him the maxime is this, <hi>Calumniare audacter aliquid adhaerebit,</hi> when all his why's, and how's, and if's have failed him, he boldly avers, that theſe Miniſters, under the pretext of the Magiſtrates Power objectively Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, granted to the Magiſtrate that which is intrinſecally and formally Eccleſiaſtical. That is, they firſt denyed to him a Power formally Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, and then they gave it again to him in grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a Power objectively Eccleſiaſtical; if ye ſay, that Power objectively Eccleſiaſtical is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily when it's aſcribed to the Magiſtrate contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from Power formally and intrinſecally Eccleſiaſtical. He will Anſwer, that if they had given a Power formally and intrinſecally Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical to the Magiſtrate in plain terms, this had been plain dealing above board, but their conveying of it to him under a pretext and cover, that none would ſuſpect their cunning conveying this intrinſick Power under the cloak of objective Power, their ſlipping the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven into the guards of the Civil Sword, or cunningly ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them together, and ſo delivering them both together to the Magiſtrate, this was indeed Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery: And ſay what they will to purge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet do not ye believe them; for they who
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:40126:213" rendition="simple:additions"/> have ſo baſely betrayed the whole Cauſe, are not to be believed; or if ye have any Charity to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them when they ſay they intended no ſuch thing, yet be ſure it was the intention of the work, though not of the worker, <hi>intentio operis,</hi> though not <hi>intentio operantis.</hi> And thus he hath proved that the whole cauſe was baſely betrayed by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration from the Cauſe, for he brings it in with a, becauſe, under the pretext, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo by a demonſtration which they call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the charge of betraying the whole Cauſe is ſtrongly concluded <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. This Demonſtration doth ſtrongly conclude that the Author of it was ſtrangely tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with Paſſion and Prejudice againſt the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſters, but it proves nothing againſt the Indulged Miniſters, but by virtue of the foreſaid maxime; Calumniate boldly, and ſomething will ſtick; for whatever was the nature of theſe Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, this is a manifeſt calumny that <hi>Mr. H.</hi> made a pretext of the Magiſtrates Power objectively Eccleſiaſtical to grant that which was intrinſecally and formally Eccleſiaſtical to the Magiſtrate: For ſuppoſe <hi>Mr. H.</hi> had thought that none of theſe Inſtructions were intrinſecally and formally Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical, yet in granting to the Magiſtrate a Power objectively Eccleſiaſtical, he did no way approve of the Magiſtrates giving theſe Inſtructions, becauſe he had deſigned theſe Inſtructions, and impoſitions burdening Miniſters in the matter of their Miniſtry; and ſo whatever Power he gave to the Magiſtrate about Eccleſiaſtick Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, he could not be ſuppoſed to yield to him a Power to make theſe impoſitions, and could no
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:40126:213"/> ways be ſuppoſed to have a deſign to grant to the Magiſtrate a Power intrinſecally Eccleſiaſtical, which he manifeſtly denied, and to make a pretext of a Power objectively Eccleſiaſtical to cover this deſign: But whither will not Paſſion and Prejudice carry men when they are once engaged in a wrong Cauſe? For ſo long as they are under theſe woful diſtempers, they will make, ere they want ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay againſt their Adverſaries. I think all who reads theſe things ſhould be thereby ſtirred up to pray, that they may not be led into temptation. But whatever was <hi>Mr. H</hi>'s. or <hi>Mr. B</hi>'s. or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe Miniſters judgments, concerning the nature of every one of theſe Inſtructions, I do not know, and therefore cannot determine; but I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Author of this Hiſtory hath not been clear himſelf; for if he had been clear to have aſſerted all the reſt, beſides the confinement intrinſecally Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, he would not have failed to have done it in this place, and to have proved it with all his pith, ſeeing it would have concluded, as he thinks, the betraying of the whole Cauſe, which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion he would have been at with all his heart, ſeeing he makes ſo many fetches to bring it about; but when all is come to all, we ſee it amounts to no more but this: That that which is as intrinſecally and formally Eccleſiaſtical as many other at leaſt are, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which clearly ſhews, that the man hath been in the miſt as to the nature of theſe Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for he does not ſay, that all theſe Inſtructions were intrinſecally and formally Eccleſiaſtical, or that any one of them was ſuch abſolutely, but onely that ſomewhat that was as intrinſecally and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:40126:214"/> Eccleſiaſtical as many other at leaſt are. But what if theſe many other which he means, be not intrinſecally Eccleſiaſtical, for he tells us not what theſe many are, nor doth he tell us any one of theſe many, that we might compare them with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions in queſtion; and then his adding at leaſt ſhews that he hath been in the dark in this matter, and durſt not determine poſitively or particularly concerning the nature of all or any of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. He durſt not determine which of them belonged to the formally Eccleſiaſtick, or which to the objectively Eccleſiaſtick Power, nor durſt he determine that they were all intrinſecally and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally Eccleſiaſtical; and if he was in doubt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, what wonder if there were doubts of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture amongſt theſe Brethren. And though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not certainly aſſert, that they had different appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions in this matter, yet I conjecture that there was ſomething of it from what I read in an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Vindication of the Miniſters who made uſe of the Indulgence, written, as is ſuppoſed, by that faithful and judicious Miniſter, Mr. <hi>Thomas Wylie,</hi> who was, as I am informed, preſent with theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters at their Meetings, though he had not then made any uſe of the Indulgence; for after he hath in Aſſertion 5. aſſerted, that it's granted without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, that the Supream Magiſtrate hath a Supream Power objectively Eccleſiaſtick about Church-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: And Aſſ. 7. That as it is the Magiſtrates ſin to reſtrain Miniſters from Preaching the Goſpel, ſo it is condeſcended to by all of the Presbyterian per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, that it is the Duty of the Magiſtrates not onely to permit and allow the Preaching of the
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:40126:214"/> Goſpel in his Dominions, but upon ſuppoſition of neglect or neceſſity it is his Duty to command Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to Preach the Goſpel. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.7, 8, 9: Jehoſhaphat <hi>ſent the Levites and Prieſts with the Book of the Law to teach all the Cities of</hi> Judah, <hi>and they went through all the Cities of</hi> Judah <hi>and taught the People.</hi> Rom. 13.4. <hi>The Magiſtrate is to them a Miniſter for good.</hi> Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi>

<pb n="436" facs="tcp:40126:215"/> of Perſons in adjacent Pariſhes, and admit them to the Communion, if they were not clear to joyn with the incumbents who had conformed: And if in the ſecond Rule they had appointed that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper ſhould be as often yearly celebrated as the conveniency of the reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Congregations would admit; and had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that Congregations lying together ſhould not have it on the ſame day, and allowed at ſuch occaſions Preaching without, and ſo of the reſt: If they had put Miniſters to their Duty, who would, or who ought to have quarrelled with the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, as out of his Duty? So it is not the Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the riſe, or conveyance, but the faultineſs of the matter, conſidering our preſent Conſtitution that makes the Rules ſinful, and not to be practiſed by honeſt men. I may add, if the Magiſtrate had appointed the Indulged Miniſters to meet Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially, that caſes which were formerly referrable to Presbyteries might be ſtill ſo referred, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by Kirk-Seſſions, I ſuppoſe none would have had reaſon to complain: And if it had been appointed that theſe Presbyteries ſhould have Clerks, and pay them their dues, I ſuppoſe none would have alledged that this was <hi>Eraſtianiſm,</hi> but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of ſomething of the former Order. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing alſo of the different apprehenſions of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters about theſe Rules, which of them were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally Eccleſiaſtical, and which miſ-applications of the Civil Power objectively Eccleſiaſtical appears in the Anſwer of the Hiſtory of the Indulgence, of which I ſpoke before; but that made no diviſion among theſe honeſt Miniſters, who looked upon
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:40126:215"/> them as impoſitions that were not to be received. And I ſuppoſe any who will impartially conſider the matter, will think that theſe Miniſters did wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in forbearing to determine peremptorily concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature of every one of theſe Rules, whether they were the exerciſe of a Power formally Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, or miſ-applications of the Civil Power object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ively Eccleſiaſtical. From what is ſaid we may ſee the Vanity of all the Hiſtorians endeavours whereby he labours to prove that Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. words were uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, or a baſe betraying of the Cauſe; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Mr. <hi>H.</hi> thought of the nature of theſe Rules, he gave an honeſt Teſtimony againſt them, as the Author is forced to confeſs in acknowledging that he ſaid the ſame upon the matter with Mr. <hi>B.</hi> but he ſpoke more fully and diſtinctly; for in his firſt Speech, which the Hiſtorian acknowledges to be the ſame upon the matter with Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. he uſes the words, impoſitions burdening in the matters of the Miniſtry, which comprehends not onely Rules for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally Eccleſiaſtical of the Magiſtrates making, but alſo all Civil injunctions which impoſe grievous bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens. And I ſuppoſe it was Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. deſign to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe both, though his words ſeem moſt directly to relate to the former, and my reaſon is this, becauſe the Reaſon which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> adds does clearly exclude all Arbitrary Civil injunctions which impoſe upon the Ambaſſadours of Chriſt, who are to adhere to their Maſters Inſtructions in the diſcharge of their Office. And as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſhews, that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> did not intend to deny the Magiſtrates juſt Power, ſo the Reaſon which he adds juſtifies what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaid more expreſly, and what he meant, and clearly
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:40126:216"/> enough inſinuate by the Reaſon which he added to his Refuſal. What the Author further adds, <hi>pag.</hi> 75 &amp; 76. to prove that the granting to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate a Power objectively Eccleſiaſtical, doth not warrant him to make Rules regulating the exerciſe of the Miniſtry and its intrinſick adminiſtration, is a very needleſs work, which his ignorant miſtake of Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. deſign in ſpeaking, and then his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable, that I ſay not perverſe, wreſting of Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. words, and deſign againſt all Reaſon and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, hath put him to; as little wit makes meickle travel: So it is no wonder, if they who tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel with ſuch a miſchievous deſign, as that is, to prove honeſt men to be baſe betrayers of the cauſe of God, be put to a great deal of pains in travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to bring forth ſuch a Monſter, and to put ſome face upon ſuch an ugly deformed Birth, and then to get it fathered upon them, who can give their Oath of verity they have nothing to do with it, and may ſafely ſay, that the Father of lies hath helped to breed it, and bring it forth.</p>
               <p>I onely obſerve two things: 1. That in the end of the 75 page, and in the beginning of the 76, he miſ-repreſents the judgment of Proteſtants, as if they gave the Magiſtrate no more but the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Diſcretion, which is common to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and diſtinguiſhes Men from Brutes: He might have learned from the writings of Proteſtants, and from the courſe of Conformity in the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cited, that beſide the judgment of Diſcretion, they give to the Magiſtrate the judgment of his Vocation. 2. Page 76. He reſtricts the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates conſideration too much, when he limits it

               <p>I am ſenſible that I have inſiſted too long in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Hiſtorian in his rovaries and blind gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, the Author who hath anſwered his whole Book ſufficiently, hath fully anſwered this part of his Book in a few lines, by ſhewing what was Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. deſign and meaning in this ſecond Speech, and then ſhews, that the Hiſtorian hood-winks himſelf, and then quibbles and quaeries, this is the meaning of it, or that is the meaning of it, and ſtarts que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions that were never ſtarted by a man of Letters in this matter, and ſuch as there were no ground for here; and having ſet up his own fancy, he beats it down again, that it might appear to the leſs judicious, that he was doing ſomething, while as he was doing nothing to the purpoſe. This
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:40126:217"/> is a full Anſwer, and all that theſe quibbling Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes deſerved. In the reſt of page 76, and in page 77, we have eight of his Magiſterial dictates, to which the Brother who anſwers him, ſets down ſo many contradictory propoſitions, which is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Anſwer. He ſhews, <hi>That the Indulgence which the Miniſters made uſe of, did neither tend, nor was intended to carry on an Invaſion of the Rights of the Church, or of the Prerogatives of Chriſt.</hi> 2. He ſhews, <hi>That it's full, and a fuller Teſtimony than that which the Hiſtorian ſo much commends.</hi> 3. <hi>That it's a plain Vindication of the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> Scotland <hi>in that particular, according to former Engagements.</hi> 4. <hi>That it was candid, ingenuous, and pertinent.</hi> 5. <hi>That it was expreſſed in terms ſolid and ſignificant, made uſe of by the ableſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, including the very words made uſe of by Mr.</hi> B. <hi>and commended by the Hiſtorian for a faithful Teſtimony: Miniſters are not obliged to make every one that hears them capable to underſtand what they very clearly ſpeak.</hi> 6. <hi>As it homologates Mr.</hi> B's. <hi>words, and made up the defects of it, ſo it contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no diſ-ingenuous reflexions upon Mr.</hi> B. 7. <hi>Though it was ſpoken with all due reſpect to the Magiſtrate, yet ſeeing a Power formally Eccleſiaſtical was denied to the Magiſtrate; and ſeeing they aſſerted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be the Servants of Chriſt in the matters of their Miniſtry, and ſo obliged to follow the will of Chriſt, and not the Magiſtrates impoſitions in theſe matters; they excluded the Magiſtrate both from the formal and elicitive Acts of the Miniſterial Calling, and from Arbitray diſpoſal of the matters of the Miniſtry.</hi> And 8. <hi>The terms are ſo ſolid ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:40126:217"/> and ſo much in uſe among Orthodox Divines, that they cannot be alledged to give too much or too little in this matter, except the generation of</hi> Anti-craſtian <hi>Orthodox Divines be condemned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Page 77. the Hiſtorian falls foul upon the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who ſaid, <hi>He could not receive Eccleſiaſtical Canons from their Lordſhips, but as for Civil ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications of their Pleaſure under the hazard of Civil Penalties, he could ſay nothing to that:</hi> And upon another who did homologate this Speech.</p>
               <p>The Hiſtorian replys firſt merrily with the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Preface of Courteſie, that what he was to ſay might not be ill taken. <hi>But,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>under fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, this is</hi> ſecundum artem volatilizare denſa &amp; denſare volatilia, <hi>a pretty whim wham good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> And then on a ſudden he turns very ſad and ſerious, and begins with an Oh. <hi>Oh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a ſerious, ſolid, zealous Miniſter ſhould have been aſhamed to have ſubſtitute ſuch whitty whatties in the place of a plain Teſtimony clearly called for in the caſe: But theſe two Perſons not onely break their own Order, and might have occaſioned ſome conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the reſt as well as Mr.</hi> B's. <hi>ſpeaking did, but alſo ſpoke indeed nothing to the purpoſe, and might as well have been ſilent. Anſw.</hi> He who prefaced for favour ſhould have ſpoken more favourably, according to the common ſaying, <hi>Ut ameris ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis eſto;</hi> but he very quickly ſpits the courteſie in a bitter gyb, which he thought would touch a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian in the quick, as an Arrow taken out of his own Quiver; he would kill him with his own wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons: And becauſe Phyſitians ordinarily love to ſpeak <hi>Latine,</hi> he ſpeaks in his own Dialect, <hi>Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:40126:218"/> artem,</hi> &amp;c. but under favour, though there be bitterneſs, I ſee not any Art, or any thing ſmart in this tart ill broken Jeſt. I perceive ſo little ſalt, either volatile or fixed in it, that it ſeems to me a very inſipid piece of Drollery. If he deſign by theſe Chymical terms to put the complement of a Cheat upon a ſerious, ſolid, zealous Miniſter, as he afterward deſigns him, there was much ſin in this ſport; and the pleaſure that is taken in doing what is diſpleaſing to God, is but a ſport for fools, and the end of that mirth is ſadneſs; the caſting of ſuch fire-brands is a ſport for mad-men, to compare the ſerious Speech of a Miniſter, who by his Calling is a worker together with God, and a worker of the work of God, to the cheating operations of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymy, the product whereof is ordinarily ſome counterfeit thing, was a very odious compariſon; and if this be the thing he means, then, as I obſerved before, that the Hiſtorian would have made no good Maſter of manners: So from this caſt of his ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing craft I perceive he would have proved but a ſpur-galled ſporter. When he ſpeaks of a whim-wham he hath forgot the half of the tale, for if I be remembred, the whole of that inſignificant tale is a whim-wham for a Gooſe-bridle; if I be wrong, the Children will correct me, the bridle was ill left out, it might have been good for ſomething, if it had been but to have reſtrained the volatile things, of which he was immediately ſpeaking, that they might not get away; for if ye hold not theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Birds by the head, it's folly to think of laying ſalt on their tail, if they once ſlip the bridle: And to follow them when they are flown, is the wildeſt
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:40126:218"/> of all Wild-gooſe Chaſes; for if they once get out of your hand, ye will never more get your eye upon them again, let be your hand, for they eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and turn to that which is next to nothing; and whether they be good for any thing or nothing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are gone, I leave the Chymiſts to enquire, who are taken up with theſe whitty whatties, as the Hiſtorian terms them: But enough, if not too much of this. The Hiſtorians unworthy abuſing of ſo worthy and deſerving a Perſon, and his treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſo grave a Perſon in ſo ridiculous a way, did not deſerve any ſerious Anſwer. If that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend and Learned Miniſter had ſpoken his mind in ſubtil evaniſhing words, having no ſenſible ſenſe, or a ſenſe not eaſily perceptible; or if he had uſed terms of Art, or words borrowed from Phyſick or Chymiſtry, or ſpoken <hi>Latine</hi> before the Council, there might have been ſome pretext for this ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Drollery; but there is nothing of all theſe in his Speech. The firſt part of his Speech is the ſame upon the matter with Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. and large as plain, if not more plain than his Speech; and it hath this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that it is more comprehenſive: For Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. Speech doth onely exclude the Magiſtrate from making Rules to Regulate Miniſters in their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Actings: This Speech excludes the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate from making all Eccleſiaſtical Canons. Now there are many Eccleſiaſtical Canons beſides theſe which Regulate the exerciſe of the Miniſtry: As for Example, If the Magiſtrate would make an Act that no Perſon ſhould bring a Child to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by a Presbyterian Miniſter, or outed Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, this would be an Eccleſiaſtical Canon, laying
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:40126:219"/> an undue reſtraint upon Miniſters who have Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be Baptized, not in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry, but in that which is common to them with other Chriſtians who have Children to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to Baptiſm. This Speech excluded this, and in general all Eccleſiaſtick Canons. The Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian alledges, that it was nothing to the purpoſe; ſure he would not have ſaid ſo of the firſt part of the Speech, if the ſecond part had not been added. Now the addition of the ſecond part was very much to the purpoſe for removing the miſtake which the Magiſtrate had conceived from Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. Speech; and the words are in my Opinion more appoſite than if he had ſaid Civil Laws or Statutes; for the Inſtructions which he had an eye to in this part of his Speech, were neither properly Laws nor Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, ſuch as the Confinement, and it may be the Act for paying the Clerks Fees. It's hard to find a more appoſite and more ſhort deſignation of Acts of that nature than that which he uſed, to wit, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſignifications of the Magiſtrates pleaſure under the hazard of Civil Penalties. And if I knew not the Hiſtorians prejudice againſt Indulged Miniſters, I could not but wonder that he makes ſuch Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal out-cries againſt ſo plain and appoſite words. The Brother who hath Anſwered this Hiſtory, in his Anſwer to this part of it, ſhews, that it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controverted among theſe Brethren, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of theſe Inſtructions were Eccleſiaſtick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons. He ſhews alſo, that the paper offered to them by the Council contained Injunctions (one at leaſt) of a Civil nature. The firſt ſort are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, the laſt he did not either directly refuſe or
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:40126:219"/> accept, reſolving to do as he ſhould (all things conſidered) find beſt. What could be more plain or ingenuous? <hi>Yet,</hi> ſays the Hiſtorian, 1. <hi>by this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction</hi> (little better than a Mental reſervation) <hi>they might have ſcrupled at nothing that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate might attempt to preſcribe in Church-matters; no, not at his giving Rules intrinſecally and formally Eccleſiaſtical, for theſe might alſo paſs as Civil ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of their pleaſure,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſw.</hi> His <hi>Parentheſis</hi> about Mental reſervation, which is a Jeſuitical Cheat and trick, confirms the ſuſpicion that his <hi>Latine</hi> Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was a <hi>periphraſis</hi> of cheatry. The Hiſtorian could hardly have done the Author a greater injury than to have charged him with one of the worſt of the Jeſuits lying tricks; but his ingenuity is ſo well known to all who know him, that the Hiſtorians Tongue and Pen will not make this ſlander ſtick to him. The Hiſtorian might rather have alledged, that it was a piece of Oratory, an <hi>Apoſiopeſis:</hi> For the Perſon of whom he ſpeaks is a good Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and they ſay, <hi>Supprimit Orator quod Ruſticus edit inepte:</hi> But to make it little better than a Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal reſervation, which even ſome Popiſh Writers, as <hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Covarruvias</hi> condemn as a lie, was a very injurious ſlander. They who make uſe of theſe Mental reſervations ſpeak that which is falſe, and which they know to be falſe, and think they ſhun lying by adding in their mind ſomewhat to what they ſpeak to make it a truth; as when they are interrogate by a Judge, even upon Oath, if they ſpoke, or did this or that? They will ſwear, that they neither did, nor ſpoke it, the Judge hears no more from them, but then they think they have
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:40126:220"/> not lied nor perjured themſelves, becauſe they have this thought in their mind, I did not ſay, or do this or that, to tell it to you who Queſtions me. So that what they ſpeak is manifeſtly a lie, but what that Brother ſpoke was truth, and I believe he ſpoke the laſt words in great ſimplicity and ſingleneſs, as not knowing what he would do, when put to it by ſuch Civil ſignifications of the Magiſtrates pleaſure, and ſo could not give any determinate Anſwer what he would do; he ſpoke like a wiſe and Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious man with great ingenuity. What would the Hiſtorian had him ſaying? Should he have ſaid, I will Obey no Civil Acts by which ye ſignifie your pleaſure, whatever be the hazard or penalty: Or would he have had him ſaying, I will Obey all the Civil Acts whereby ye ſignifie your pleaſure: both theſe had been raſh and unwarrantable Anſwers, which no Conſciencious man who underſtands what he ſays, can give to any Magiſtrate who hath Civil Authority over him. And I ſuppoſe if the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian had been in his caſe, and had abſolutely refuſed to keep the confinement, or pay the Clerks Fees; if the Magiſtrate had certified him, that if he kept not his confinement, he would lay him by the heels in a Priſon; and ſeeing the Magiſtrate did allow him the ſtipend; and yet he would not pay a little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney at their command, that they would Authorize the Clerk to take him with caption. I ſuppoſe in this caſe the Hiſtorian would have been in ſome ſwither what to ſay or do, and would have taken ſome time to adviſe. And it's very ſtrange that he imagines, that they who ſpoke thus might have ſcrupled at nothing; no, not at the Magiſtrates
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:40126:220"/> Rules intrinſecally Eccleſiaſtical, ſeeing they had expreſly declared they could not receive ſuch Rules. <hi>But,</hi> ſays he, <hi>theſe may paſs under the notion of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſignifications of their pleaſure.</hi> He might have as well ſaid, that black may paſs under the notion of white, and the Magiſtrate may paſs under the notion of the Miniſter, and the State under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kirk: For Eccleſiaſtical Canons, and Civil ſignifications of the Magiſtrates pleaſure were as clearly contra-diſtinguiſhed one from another as theſe things ſpoken of; ſo that Canons intrinſecal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Eccleſiaſtical coming from the Magiſtrate to theſe Brethren, could never have paſſed with them as Civil ſignifications, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> except they had paſſed from what they had preſently aſſerted in the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates hearing, and to his face: And the coming of theſe Canons from the Magiſtrate would not have turned them into Civil ſignifications or the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates pleaſure; for they had ſaid, that they could receive no Eccleſiaſtical Canons from their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips. Now if their coming from the Magiſtrate had turned them into Civil Acts, and theſe Brethren had thought that the Magiſtrates giving of them would change their nature, they would have thought it impoſſible for the Magiſtrate to give any Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick Canons, and ſo it had been a very ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous tale to have told they could not receive that from the Magiſtrate which it's impoſſible for the Magiſtrate to give; it had been juſt as if a man would gravely aſſert, I will drink no water out of the fire; for its impoſſible that fire can give water, and as impoſſible upon the foreſaid ſuppoſition, that the Magiſtrate can give Eccleſiaſtick Canons,
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:40126:221"/> becauſe his very giving them would make them Civil. It's as wild an imagination, that he thinks theſe Brethren by Eccleſiaſtical Canons meant only Canons framed and given by men in Church Office, as if they had ſaid, we cannot receive from your Lordſhips, who are Magiſtrates, Canons which ye cannot give, becauſe they can onely be given by Kirk-men, and your Lordſhips are not men in Church-Office. It's a fooliſh thing to follow the Hiſtorian in the reſt of his Extravagancies. Pag. 78. He Argues as if theſe Brethren made no diſtinction betwixt the nature of Eccleſiaſtical Canons and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Acts ſignifying the Magiſtrates pleaſure; and as if they had declared, that they would receive all which the Magiſtrate gave under the notion of Civil ſignifications, and if ye will grant him theſe conceſſions (which are manifeſtly falſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the expreſs words of theſe Brethren) then he will, <hi>ex conceſſis,</hi> prove that the Cauſe was plainly given up. I wonder much how ſuch fancies could enter in his Head, but I wonder much more that upon his own groundleſs imaginations he could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſuch horrid ſlanders againſt honeſt Miniſters. The Brother who hath Anſwered this Hiſtory, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath ſolidly cleared theſe two Brethrens words, and vindicate them, he concludes. Thus our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian here hood-winks himſelf again, and, like a Boy playing at belly blind with a bonnet over his face, gropes here, and gropes there, and makes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral falſe ſuppoſitions, coyns ſeveral falſe ſenſes, ſets them up and dings them down, bravely and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxly indeed. What the Hiſtorian ſays, <hi>pag.</hi> 79. of theſe two Brethren, that they hinted by their
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:40126:221"/> Anſwers and Diſtinction, that a Power formally Eccleſiaſtical is denominated ſo, not becauſe it is ſo in it ſelf, but meerly becauſe it is exerted by Church-men, is manifeſtly falſe: This is a hint minted by his own prejudice and erring imagination, which was wofully habituated to ſuch falſe and injurious imaginations. For the firſt part of their Speech, which relates to Canons Eccleſiaſtical, makes no mention at all of Church-men, nor ſpeaks of any reference of Eccleſiaſtical Canons to Church-men; they onely ſay, they could not receive Eccleſiaſtical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons from their Lordſhips.</p>
               <p>Page 79. The firſt part of Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. Speech, which he reſumed, as hath been often obſerved, does overturn <hi>Eraſtianiſm,</hi> and excludes the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate from making Rules intrinſecally Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, whether for Regulating Miniſters or Church-members; for he who hath not a Power formally Eccleſiaſtical, cannot form Canons which are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally and intrinſecally Eccleſiaſtical. The Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians additional Anſwer is already Anſwered. As to theſe words which follow, <hi>Intimating withal, that the Brethren would either obſerve or not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Directions, according as they judged of them in their Conſcience upon their peril.</hi> The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian Anſwers, <hi>And was this all? Is it all one at whoſe hands Miniſters receive Directions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to Regulate them in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry,</hi> &amp;c. I Anſwer, although the words as they are related by the Informer, who was not preſent, but did write no doubt according to his Information, will bear a fair conſtruction: For if Mr. <hi>H.</hi> hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as the Informer relates, I think it is more than
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:40126:222"/> probable that be hath been ſpeaking of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils commands in general and indefinitely, and I am confirmed in this from the words as they ſtand. The Brother who Anſwers the Hiſtory, ſays, there were other things ſpoken beſide what the Informer relates; and I am very much inclined to think that the ſpeeches which paſſed betwixt my L. Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and the Miniſters, and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> hath carried Mr. <hi>H.</hi> to ſpeak in the general concerning the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns Obedience to the Councils Directions, that they would either obſerve or not obſerve their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Directions as they judged of them in their Conſciences upon their peril. I ſay, I am confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this by the words as they ſtand, for he does not ſay theſe Injunctions, or Inſtructions, or Rules, which are the terms by which theſe Inſtructions were expreſſed: But he ſays Directions; and then he ſays, not theſe Directions, but their Directions, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending all commands which might come from the Council: If this was the thing he deſigned, there is no occaſion of carping at his words; for no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can with any ſhadow of Reaſon ſay, that a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſpeaking thus to the Magiſtrate, <hi>I will obſerve or not obſerve your commands according as I ſhall judge of them in my Conſcience:</hi> I ſay, none can ſay, that that Subject gives more than enough to the Magiſtrate. But ſuppoſe his words relate onely to theſe Directions, yet no Perſon of Candour can alledge, that they were undetermined as to their obſerving or not obſerving the Inſtructions, which they judged intrinſecally Eccleſiaſtical; ſeeing they had declared to the Magiſtrate they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe from their Lordſhips, that was a thing
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:40126:222" rendition="simple:additions"/> that they had judged in their Conſcience already; but the Confinement, and it may be the Act for paying the Clerks Fees, hath occaſioned his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering in that manner, not being peremptory as to ſuch things, according as the two Brethren had ſaid before that as to Civil ſignifications, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But from what I find in other papers of Brethren who were preſent, whoſe words, none who know them will queſtion. I perceive that the Informer hath not gotten full Information, for one of theſe Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren relates, that the Brother who was choſen to make uſe of the paper that was drawn as a Directory for what he was to ſay in their name, upon ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition the paper with Inſtructions were offered, did in the face of the Council declare, that it was not in the Magiſtrates Power to make Rules intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally Eccleſiaſtical to Regulate Miniſters in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their Miniſtry, and that their Lordſhips knew our Divines ſay ſo: To which my L. Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour anſwered, <hi>Sir, we know what belongs to our Office as well as you, what belongs to your.</hi> And as to my Lord Chancellours Anſwer, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a threatning to puniſh, I related before from the Anſwer of this Hiſtory, written by a Miniſter who was preſent, that it was in theſe words, and no other, <hi>Then, Sir, we will puniſh you.</hi> Unto which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> did not reply in words, but onely in geſture; hence, ſays he, it's needleſs to debate upon things that were not ſpoken: Onely, 1. It's clear by my L. Chancellours reply, that he underſtood theſe Miniſters as refuſing Obedience to theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, otherwiſe he would not have uttered theſe words. 2. That the Hiſtorians alledgeance
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:40126:223"/> that the puniſhment threatned by my L. Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour might comprehend Eccleſiaſtical puniſhment, as he calls it, is groundleſs and irrational. The Kings Letter grants not to the Council the Power of inflicting Church cenſures, if the King had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them that Power to inflict Cenſures, they would alſo have had Power to take them off; but as he ſhews in his Anſwer to the firſt Remark of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian on the Kings Letter, they ſiſted to Indulge ſome whom they intended to Indulge, till the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop had taken off the Sentence of Depoſition. So that the Council did not pretend by virtue of the Kings Letter, to impoſe or remove Church-cenſures. And the Council knew that the Indulged Miniſters would not ſubmit to the Biſhops Cenſures, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's a groundleſs dream, that by puniſhment Church-cenſure is meant. He adds, That the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate might have commanded the Indulged Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to inflict Cenſures upon themſelves, as they uſed to do formerly in Presbyterial Courts.</p>
               <p>Page 80. <hi>We heard</hi> (ſaith the Hiſtorian) <hi>of Rules intrinſecally,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but we heard of no aſſumption that ſuch were the Rules contained in the paper tendred unto them, nor of a concluſion, that therefore they could not, they might not in Conſcience accept of them. Anſw.</hi> The Hiſtorian hath not conſidered, 1. Who theſe Miniſters were, they were not School-boys, tyed to the formalities of Arguing <hi>Categoricè in modo &amp; figura.</hi> Nor 2. Where they were, they were not in the School, ingaged in a School-diſpute, but before the ſecret Council, where formal Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſms are accounted pedantry. Nor 3. Hath he conſidered the part they ſuſtained there, for they
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:40126:223"/> were Defendants, and if the Defendant deny and diſtinguiſh, he does enough; and if he give alſo a reaſon of his denial, he does abundantly. Now theſe Miniſters acted all theſe parts very diſtinctly and rationally, as we have ſeen already. When the Apoſtles are brought before the Council, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. they get another manner of Injunction than any in the Act of Inſtructions; for they are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to ſpeak at all, nor teach in the Name of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> This was an Inſtruction which tended to the deſtruction, not only of the Goſpel-Miniſtry, but of all Chriſtianity: This was one of the worſt Councils, and this one of the worſt Inſtructions that ever was; for this Council was gathered directly againſt Chriſt, and this Inſtruction was for the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal deſtruction of Chriſtianity root and branch, and for the total Subverſion of the Kingdom of Chriſt, of the Church, the Miniſtry, the Goſpel, and of all private Conference about Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This was worſe than any Sect of <hi>Eraſtianiſm</hi> we have yet heard of, let be ſeen, and yet the Apoſtles enter not in debate with that Council about the Councils Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to meddle in ſuch matters; they do not make Syllogiſms againſt the Councils capacity of Acting, nor againſt the Act they had made; yea, they do not <hi>in terminis,</hi> ſay, they will not obey the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils command: Nor ſay they, <hi>in terminis,</hi> that they would ſpeak and teach in the name of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> They forbear a direct and formal Contradiction <hi>in termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> but they do that which was leſs irritating, but much better, and more for the Advantage of their Cauſe. Their Anſwer (which is in theſe words, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.19, 20. <hi>Whether it be right in the ſight of
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:40126:224"/> God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye; for we cannot but ſpeak the things which we have ſeen and heard</hi>) is a real and rational refuſal to do what the Council commanded, and the Council underſtood it ſo, and therefore threatned them further; and ſuch rational qualified Anſwers, which are real refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of wrong commands, are much more to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and Edification of all that hear them, than flat Contradictions not qualified with ſolid Reaſons. When the Apoſtles come to their Company, they relate the matter, and they are well ſatisfied with their behaviour; they ſay not, why entred ye not a Proteſtation againſt that <hi>Anti-chriſtian</hi> Council, that was not gathered in the Name of Chriſt, but againſt Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Why did ye not in expreſs terms ſay, that ye would receive no commands from them? Why ſaid ye not in expreſs terms, that ye would ſpeak at all occaſions, and teach in the name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and ſo flatly, and <hi>in terminis,</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted the Councils Injunction? Why ſpoke ye in ſuch general terms of ſpeaking the things that ye had heard and ſeen? Why ſaid ye not, <hi>in terminis,</hi> that ye would obey God, and that ye would not obey the Council, and that the command of the Council was contrary to the command of God? Teſtimonies cannot be too plain, ye ſhould have been more particular. Why did ye not frame an Argument againſt them thus, When the command of men is contrary to the command of God, then it is not to be obeyed; but your command that ye have given to us at this time is contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God: And therefore we will not obey this your command. But theſe good honeſt Primitive
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:40126:224"/> Chriſtians, who were Acted by the Spirit of Love, were not ſo captious nor cenſorious. In the 5th. Chap. <hi>After they had beaten them, they command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they ſhould not ſpeak in the Name of Jeſus, and let them go.</hi> We do not hear that the Apoſtles ſaid any thing after they were beaten, againſt that new Injunction, but they had not a mind to Obey it, and they make that clear by their practice, for they ceaſed not to Preach <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> daily in the Temple, and in every Houſe. The Diſciples do not refuſe to hear them becauſe they had given no verbal Teſtimony againſt that laſt Injunction, or becauſe they had not the laſt word; ſeeing they did really diſobey that Injunction in Preaching the Goſpel, they made no quarrel either at their ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or at their ſilence when beaten, they were glad that the Council had let them go, and had not ſhut them up in Priſon, nor put them to death; they were glad that they were living and at liberty to Preach in the Name of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> 4. The Hiſtorian commended Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. Speech, and yet he made no Aſſumption nor Concluſion; and why finds he fault with Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. Speech upon this Account, that he did not ſubſume and conclude. 5. The Author of this ſtory could not have ſubſumed that all theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions are formally and intrinſecally Eecleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, for he grants at leaſt that one of them was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Political, and the Brother who anſwers his Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſays, that that Inſtruction about Burſers and Clerks is about <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a thing pertaining to this life, and of very ſmall conſideration, and no way regulative of the Miniſtry; a thing alſo that falls immediately and directly under the Superiority
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:40126:225"/> and Juriſdiction of the Supreme Civil Magiſtrate, although for its remote and mediate end it have a Spiritual good. And it may be the Brethren had different apprehenſions about ſome of theſe Rules, and ſo ſome would have ſubſumed more in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption than others, and this would have made a difference of their apprehenſions manifeſt before the Council, which was needleſs, ſeeing they were all agreed that they were gravaminous impoſitions, and that theſe who were intrinſecally Eccleſiaſtical, regulating the exerciſe of the Miniſtry, could not be received.</p>
               <p>That the Hiſtorian could not underſtand to what purpoſe the Magiſtrates Power objectively Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical was conceded except for juſtifying the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates giving, and the Miniſters receiving theſe Inſtructions, did proceed from his Paſſion and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, which blinded his underſtanding, as we have clearly manifeſted by ſhewing what was Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. deſign in that part of his Diſcourſe. I ſuppoſe he as much miſtakes the Informers deſign, <hi>pag.</hi> 81. In that ſame page he craves leave to add, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters Declaration was annulled by their receiving of the papers. We could not hinder him to make that addition, but we proteſt, that it may be added to the reſt of his falſe imaginations, and ſo let it paſs with the reſt of his Errors; he hath forgotten that this condemns Mr. <hi>Blair,</hi> and annuls his Teſtimony, for he took the paper in his hand, which ſeveral of the Brethren did not. It's as falſe that the Power impoſing theſe Inſtructions was ſo lightly paſſed; for Mr. <hi>H.</hi> declared, that the Magiſtrate had not a Power formally Eccleſiaſtical, and gave a ſolid
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:40126:225"/> Reaſon why they could not impoſe burdens upon Miniſters in the matters of their Miniſtry, becauſe they were the Servants of Chriſt, and ſo at his will, and not at the will and pleaſure of men in theſe matters. The Informer will deny what the Hiſtorian, <hi>pag.</hi> 82 ſays, was hinted by him. I perceive by what the Hiſtorian hath here, <hi>pag.</hi> 81 &amp; 82, that he can allow more to a Godly Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Magiſtrate, than to Magiſtrates that are open Enemies, and yet he hath granted before that all that agrees to a Magiſtrate as Magiſtrate, agrees to every Magiſtrate, and ſo he can allow more to a Godly Magiſtrate, than agrees to the Magiſtrate as Magiſtrate. Again, he grants, that in a time of univerſal defection and deformation, which can no other way be remedied, that Magiſtrates may give Rules and Injunctions to Regulate Miniſters in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry, for he grants that Godly Divines have granted this to be given to extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and immediately inſpired Magiſtrates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or they have granted it in a time of univerſal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the firſt of theſe conceſſions, that more may be allowed to Magiſtrates really minding Reformation, than to Magiſtrates as Magiſtrates: I would enquire what Warrant he hath for giving this allowance for theſe divers Weights and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to the good and bad Magiſtrate, in defining the limits of their Power and Office, as the Informer ſpeaks. By what Rule gives he one grain of more Power and Authority about theſe things which are the matters of God, to one Magiſtrate, than God hath given to all Magiſtrates? The Power of the Magiſtrate about things Sacred is given and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:40126:226"/> by God, and is not to be enlarged and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by mens allowance or diſallowance: This is kittle work, if the Magiſtrates Power about ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things may be enlarged by mens allowance, why may not Miniſters Power in the adminiſtration of Holy things be enlarged alſo, and more allowed to eminent Godly Miniſters, who minds Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? This hath been a pretext for Prelacy, and it will go far to make a Biſhop. Again, how much more would he allow to Reforming Magiſtrates, when he hath once paſt the limits that God hath ſet, where will he ſtay? What Rule have we for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting bounds to this allowance in the matter of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Authority; the moſt part of men loves well to have <hi>ulterius</hi> for their Motto; muſt this depend upon the will of Kirk-men? But as the miſguided will of Kirk-men ſet up an Eccleſiaſtick Pope, why may it not alſo ſet up a Civil Pope? If the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſpoſition to Reform be the Rule, then the more a Magiſtrate minds the glory of God, he muſt have the more Power allowed. What if a Magiſtrate ſeem very Zealous for Reformation, till he hath gotten very much Power, and then he turn an Adverſary; how will ye get back the Power which ye have given away? The Magiſtrate will not readily give Subjects allowance to take back what they have given. Again, how can ye fairly refuſe to a bad Magiſtrate who ſucceds to a good Predeceſſour what was allowed to his Predeceſſour? Such a refuſal would be a great temptation to make a bad Magiſtrate worſe. I ſhall not inſiſt on this further, but the little that hath been ſaid may ſhew, that it's much ſafer to hold that all Magiſtrates have
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:40126:226"/> the ſame Official Power in reference to Church-matters; and that even <hi>Nero,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Rutherfurd</hi> ſays, had that, as all Miniſters that are Miniſters have, the ſame Miniſterial Authority. And all Magiſtrates have in a time of defection and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation the ſame Authority for reducing things to Order, when they can be no other way remedied. If an Indulged Miniſter had granted that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate might in any caſe give Rules and Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Regulate Miniſters in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry, which yet the Hiſtorian grants in a time of univerſal defection and deformation, which can no other way be remedied; it's very like the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian would have charged them with the betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the whole Cauſe. I wonder that he who grants this to the Magiſtrate at ſome times, ſhould have made ſuch horrible out-cries againſt the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſters, though they had done what he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges upon them: He hath fore-ſeen this Objection, and therefore he ſubjoyns, <hi>This cannot be applyed to our Caſe.</hi> But might not honeſt men be of that Opinion, that this was our caſe, and though miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in their Opinion, is that a ſufficient ground to charge them with betraying the whole Cauſe? Our caſe looks very like a caſe of defection and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and this Book of his hath helped on the deformation. He looks on the Indulged Miniſters, and the Miniſters who are for hearing of them, and thoſe who adhere to them, as in a courſe of defection. But though at other times he makes a very general defection, and alledges that the outed Miniſters who are not Indulged, are Acted by a Spirit of Anti-chriſt, yet here he will not grant a defection or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:40126:227"/> for fear leſt he be obliged by his own conceſſion to grant the Magiſtrate a Power of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Rules, and I ſuppoſe before he granted that, he would deny all that he hath ſaid in other places, of the defection and deformation of the Church. <hi>And further,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I wonder how he thinketh any can judge otherwiſe than that Interpretatively at leaſt the receiving of theſe papers on theſe terms was a giving up of the right of the Church with their own hands.</hi> But what if his wondering be, as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily wondering is, the Daughter of Ignorance, O not ſo, his wondering is the Daughter of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Light, for he ſubjoyns, <hi>Seeing it is ſo clear and manifeſt by what we have ſaid.</hi> And then he makes another Inference from the manifeſt clearneſs of what he hath ſaid: And what is that? <hi>And</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſeeing it is ſo, himſelf</hi> (that's the Informer) <hi>will, I ſuppoſe, grant, that every Miniſter is called highly to reſent this Treachery.</hi> And thus he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes that the Informer is turned one of his Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes, if ye will do him the favour to believe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Evidence, that all that he hath ſaid is clear and manifeſt, he will bring you to believe that the Moon is made of green Cheeſe: He will ſet every mans hand againſt his Brother, and bring every Miniſter to account all that Treachery which he himſelf calls Treachery. But the Informer is none of theſe credulous Perſons, to grant any thing that the Hiſtorian would impoſe upon him as clear and manifeſt, becauſe he hath ſaid it. What followeth hath been anſwered before; his miſtaking of Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. purpoſe in aſcribing to the Magiſtrate a Power objectively Eccleſiaſtical, hath led him into many
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:40126:227"/> abſurdities. Page 83. he looks on it as an abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity to infer from the judgment of Diſcretion, which every private man hath to judge of his own Act about things Civil, to infer that therefore private Perſons can preſcribe Rules to Regulate Magiſtrates in the exerciſe of their Function; and he had good Reaſon to judge ſo. But the ſeeds of Sedition and Schiſm, of the contempt of Magiſtracy and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry which are ſown in this Hiſtory, and the Letter before it in the Cup of cold water, and in other Letters written by theſe Authors, have grown up ſo faſt (for ill Weeds wax well) that they have brought forth a late Band and Declaration, Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed at <hi>Sanchar,</hi> in which private Perſons does much more, than the giving Rules to Magiſtrates and Miniſters amounts to, for they in theſe papers exauctorates the Magiſtrates, and appoints their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution for purging the Land, and overturns the eſtabliſhed Civil Government, and appoints a new one, and new Laws for this new Common-wealth, and they renounce communion with all who joyn not with them in theſe things; and will own no Miniſters who differs from them for Miniſters, till they ſtand in judgment before the Miniſters who are of their way, which at moſt, for any thing I could learn, were but three, and two of them young men, whoſe Ordination was queſtioned. I hear now alſo of a new Excommunication which I have not ſeen. There is neither judgment nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion in theſe Practices, but a dreadful judicial giddineſs, which ſhould make all tremble and take heed of the firſt Seeds of Sedition and Schiſm, which leads to confuſion and deſolation. His granting,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:40126:228"/> 
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 83. to the Magiſtrate a Power about the ſame things wherein the Eccleſiaſtical Power is exerciſed in, ſo far as concerneth the outward diſpoſing of Divine things in this or that Dominion; and then leaving it without explication to limit this outward diſpoſing, is a conceſſion that if an Indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had ſaid it, all the explications he could have added would not have cleared it from a homologa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Act of Supremacy. O, what Tragical exclamations would the Hiſtorian have made againſt them! This outward diſpoſing of Divine things would have been made as much of as the Act of Supremacy amounts to. This Author hath been one of the unhappieſt ridder of Marches betwixt the Magiſtrates and Miniſters that I have met with, for he is ordinarily in extreams, either giving too much or too little. In the end of <hi>pag.</hi> 84. he ſays, <hi>That this Teſtimony was general, impertinent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, indiſtinct, and defective— and that there was much puſillanimity, diſ-ingenuity, carnal conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in it, and that it was a meer</hi> cothurnus, <hi>that is, that which may be turned any way. Anſw.</hi> It's ſtrange that the Author who profeſſes elſewhere, that Teſtimonies ſhould be made much of, that he could make nothing of this Teſtimony, but makes it worſe than nothing, even a betraying of the Cauſe. Seeing there were none who had ſaid ſo much before the Magiſtrate by way of Teſtimony to the Truth, as the Indulged Miniſters did: If he had not been much diſtempered and byaſſed with Paſſion and Prejudice, he would for the Truths ſake have made as much of this Teſtimony as he could in truth, but he contrary to truth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:40126:228"/> ſenſe, perverts and wreſts it to turn it into Treachery. The Reverend Brother who hath An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered this Hiſtory, hath ſhewed, that the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſters had concurred with the reſt of the outed Miniſters, 1. In a real and practical Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which conſiſts poſitively in adhering to all their former Principles, Profeſſions, and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and in practiſing them as far as was poſſible: And negatively, in keeping themſelves free from every piece of defection, and from all impoſitions inconſiſtent with the truths and Inſtitutions of Chriſt, their former Principles, Profeſſions, and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which was <hi>a holding faſt of their Profeſſion without wavering,</hi> Heb. 10.23. <hi>The keeping of their Garments clean,</hi> Rev. 3.4. And being faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Death. This is the principal thing, upon the account whereof thoſe who ſuffered in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times were called Martyrs, and the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Indulged Miniſters in holding up this Teſtimony he clears at great length. 2. In a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal or Concional Teſtimony in Preaching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the evils of the Times, diſcovering and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing them from the Word of God, and exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to abſtain from them: <hi>And herein,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Indulged Miniſters have not been behind with any other faithful Miniſters, though they made not this the All of their work, having many other neceſſary Goſpel-truths to explain, inculcate, and preſs.</hi> 3. As for that third ſort of Teſtimony, by way of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Declaration in their own name, and in the name of all adhering to them, which is the proper work of a Church-Judicatory, and more formally of a general Aſſembly, or National Synod, and
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:40126:229"/> which hardly can be expected from the hands of a broken and ſcattered remnant, who hardly can meet together without great hazard; he ſhews, that in reference to this, the Indulged Miniſters have not been behind any Godly Miniſters in endeavouring it. As for the fourth ſort of Teſtimony, ſpoken of, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.18. <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18. the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Miniſters have done more this way than others in their reſpective appearances before the Council at the giving of the firſt Indulgence, and the appearance occaſioned by their not keeping the 29th. of <hi>May:</hi> And any who will but conſider what is Recorded and remembred of theſe matters, will ſee a very clear and diſtinct confeſſion before Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the truths eſpecially called in queſtion in theſe times. Conſider their Declaration with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to theſe Queſtions, and this will be very evident.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>From whom have ye received your Miniſtry? Anſw.</hi> We have received our Miniſtry from Jeſus Chriſt. Q. <hi>From whom have ye your preſcriptions to Regulate you in your Miniſtry? A.</hi> From Jeſus Chriſt. Q. <hi>Are theſe preſcriptions full, or defective, ſo that other preſcriptions may be ſuperadded? A.</hi> Theſe preſcriptions are full. Q. <hi>To whom muſt ye make account of the diſcharge of your Miniſtry? A.</hi> To Jeſus Chriſt. Q. <hi>Whoſe Miniſters are ye? A.</hi> The Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt. Q. <hi>Will ye be faithful Miniſters to him? A.</hi> We purpoſe and reſolve ſo. Q. <hi>What is your Judgment in Church-Affairs? A.</hi> Our Judgment in Church-Affairs is known, that it's the ſame it was, and that is no ſecret, but well known. Object. <hi>But your
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:40126:229"/> known judgment in Church-Affairs is oppoſite to the Government now ſettled in the Church by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, and therefore it can hardly be expected that ye will be Loyal to the King, who hath ſettled a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which conſiſts not with your known judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Anſw.</hi> Notwithſtanding of our known judgments in the matters of Church-Government, yet we will behave as becometh Loyal Subjects. Object. <hi>But your Loyal behaviour will onely be from fear, and for your own eaſe. Anſw.</hi> We look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Lawful Authority as the excellent Ordinance of God, and will be Loyal Subjects from a Lawful Principle of Conſcience: Theſe things are clear in Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. Speech. Q. <hi>Hath the Magiſtrate a Power formally Eccleſiaſtical? A.</hi> A Power formally Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical cannot be allowed to the Magiſtrate. Q. <hi>Can ye receive Inſtructions Regulating you in the exerciſe of your Miniſtry, or Inſtructions intrinſecally and formally Eccleſiaſtical Regulating you in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of your Miniſtry, from the Magiſtrate? A.</hi> We cannot receive Inſtructions intrinſecally and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally Eccleſiaſtical Regulating us in the exerciſe of our Miniſtry, from the Magiſtrate. Q. <hi>Whoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are ye in the matters of your Miniſtry, whoſe will and pleaſure ye muſt obey? A.</hi> In the matters of our Miniſtry we are the Servants of Chriſt. Q. <hi>May not the Magiſtrate lay on burdens upon you in the matters of your Miniſtry by his Authority? A.</hi> Such commands are impoſitions; it's our earneſt deſire that the Magiſtrate may not burden our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry with ſuch impoſitions, for we are the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt in theſe matters; but if he do lay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n ſuch impoſitions, we cannot approve or receive
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:40126:230"/> them, for we are the Servants of Chriſt in theſe matters; as theſe matters are the matters of Chriſt, and we his Servants in theſe matters, ſo we muſt be at his will in theſe matters. Obj. <hi>Then ye give the Magiſtrate no Power in reference to you that's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and your Miniſterial actings; and is not this juſt the Popiſh error, who exempts their Clergy-men from Subjection to the Magiſtrate? A.</hi> We wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly grant to the Magiſtrate all that Power that God and Orthodox Divines gives to him; for though the Magiſtrate may not make Religious and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical matters which God hath not made, and though he may not exerce any Act which formally and intrinſecally is a Miniſterial Act, yet he hath a Power converſant about Eccleſiaſtical matters or objects, which they call a Power objectively Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, by which he may command Miniſters and private Perſons in his Dominions to do what God hath commanded them to do, and put both Miniſters and others to ſerve God in their ſtations, he may add his Sanction to Eccleſiaſtical Canons made by Eccleſiaſtical Courts, and preſs the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of them, under Civil Penalties. Obj. <hi>Yes, yes, any thing that Kirk-men does, he may come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and back it, and is that all? A.</hi> We do not ſay, that the Magiſtrate muſt blindly execute what the Eccleſiaſtical Courts concludes; we acknowledge that he hath the judgment of his Vocation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may judge whether their Concluſions be for the Spiritual weal and Temporal Peace of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and according as he finds cauſe, either coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance or diſcountenance them in what they do. If a Synod were ſo far wrong, as to make an Act
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:40126:230"/> for Worſhipping Images, as the ſecond <hi>Nicen</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil did, he may diſcountenance them, and puniſh the makers or keepers of that Idolatrous Decree: If they make Decrees contrary to Religion and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, he ſhould diſcountenance them, and not ſuffer his Subjects to be abuſed by ſuch Canons. If any object, that this conceſſion gives the Magiſtrate Power to overturn all, I anſwer not at all, for it's onely a Power to preſerve the matters of God (which are the object about which his Power is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant) where they are in purity, or to reſtore them to their purity and integrity. If ye ſay, what if the Magiſtrate err, and be miſtaken? I anſwer, what if Kirk-men be miſtaken, and conclude wrong things? Both theſe are very caſeable ſuppoſitions that hath followed upon that woful ſuppoſition of <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall; but the errors that both Magiſtrates and Miniſters are ſubject to, muſt not make us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny either of them the Power which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them, or confound their Offices, which God hath made diſtinct. The Hiſtorian ſays, <hi>it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. Anſw.</hi> It behoved to be ſo, becauſe it was to comprehend many particulars. Again, Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. Teſtimony, which he commends, was general; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, ſome of the Brethren made particular excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt particular Inſtructions, againſt one, as bringing them in ſubordination to Prelacy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their Principles, againſt another as impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. If he mean that it had no particular refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to theſe Inſtructions, this will be like the reſt of his imaginations. The time, the place, the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of theſe Speeches, the particular pointing at ſome of the Inſtructions, the comprehending of
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:40126:231"/> them in the more general deſignation of impoſitions, and others of them in that deſcription of them, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions formally and intrinſecally Eccleſiaſtical, Regulating the exerciſe of the Miniſtry, ſhews, that theſe Miniſters were not ſpeaking of Inſtructions in <hi>Utopia,</hi> and my L. Chancellour knew well enough that they were ſpeaking of theſe Inſtructions, for he would not have threatned to puniſh them for not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Inſtructions which the Magiſtrate had never given to them. <hi>Then,</hi> he ſays, <hi>it was impertinent, confuſed, indiſtinct. Anſw.</hi> He hath by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed quibbling endeavoured to make it appear ſo, but the pertinency and clearneſs of it is manifeſt to all who will not ſhut their eyes, and the imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of his confuſed queſtions, which have their riſe from his own confuſed fancy, and not from the matter, which gave no occaſion for them, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently diſcovered. He ſays, <hi>it's defective. Anſw.</hi> I refer the Reader to the Anſwers of the fore-going Queſtions, which are the words, or the obvious and manifeſt ſenſe of their words before the Council, and then to the conſideration of all the genuine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, which neceſſarily and clearly follows, from theſe truths aſſerted in theſe Anſwers; and then let him judge, whether their Teſtimony was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective.</p>
               <p>In denying to the Magiſtrate a Power formally Eccleſiaſtical, all <hi>Eraſtianiſm,</hi> properly ſo called, is excluded; and in aſſerting that in the matters of the Miniſtry, they are Chriſts Servants, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not the Servants of men, in theſe matters; and in deſigning Acts burdening their Miniſtry, by the name of impoſitions, they have clearly ſhewed,
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:40126:231"/> that theſe matters are not at the will and pleaſure of men; for if the Magiſtrate might warrantably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand what he pleaſed in theſe matters, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands would not be impoſitions, but Lawful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Now if the Lord would incline the hearts of Rulers to forbear to aſſume a Power formally Eccleſiaſtical, that's the Power of the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and to forbear to burden the Church with impoſitions, commanding what the Lord hath forbidden, or forbidding what the Lord alloweth; or hindring and marring the Servants of Chriſt in his Service: I ſuppoſe none who were judicious, would complain, though they uſed their objective Power, in commanding what God hath commanded, and forbidding what he hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and preſſing theſe commands, where there is need, with Civil Penalties: And the Servants of Chriſt would rejoyce to ſee the Civil Magiſtrate uſing the Civil Power, which he hath from God, for the glory of God, in putting the Miniſters of Chriſt to their Duty. He ſays, <hi>There was in this way of vindicating Truth, much puſillanimity, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuity, carnal conſultation, occaſioning miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and blindneſs. Anſw.</hi> The Hiſtorians blindneſs in and miſconceptions of this matter, hath occaſioned and cauſed this falſe and uncharitable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation: All who know theſe Miniſters, knows their candour and ingenuity; and their Brethren, who were with them at their meetings at that time, can witneſs their integrity; and their words ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered before the Council do evidence. They evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced much more courage before the Magiſtrate than the Author did, when brought before the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:40126:232"/> for any thing I can hear; but ordinarily men who have leaſt courage, are moſt vehement exacters of it in others, and moſt ready to upbraid others with puſillanimity; they uſe to talk much of courage when they are at a good diſtance from the place where danger is, but when they come where the fray is, they are as afraid as other folk. The Brother who hath anſwered this Hiſtory, relates, that a Miniſter who was brought before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil in the year 1662. for calling his Neighbour a Knave, becauſe, contrary to his promiſe, he had gone to the firſt <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Synod, being interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, wherefore he called his Neighbouring Miniſter a Knave? He anſwered, becauſe he ſaid one thing, and did another. This Anſwer was much more general and abſtract from Prelacy or Supremacy and Covenant-breaking, than the Anſwers of the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſters; the reaſon why he called him a Knave really, was his conforming to Prelacy, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the Supremacy, and his Covenant-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But the Brother who is ſo much for particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, plain, diſtinct Teſtimony in others, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himſelf with this confuſed general. He adds, that another Brother, who in the preceeding year, was brought before the Parliament for aſſerting the Obligation of the Covenant, in a Sermon; when he compeared, all his Teſtimony was, a mincing of theſe expreſſions made uſe of in that Sermon. But, ſaith he, I pitied him, becauſe he was in haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of his Life. And yet both theſe Brethren have exclaimed much againſt the Indulged Miniſters, for not giving a plain, open, full Teſtimony before the Rulers. Several People would have a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:40126:232"/> as the Cat would have fiſh without wetting their feet; <hi>Catus amat piſcem, ſed non vult tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere lympham;</hi> or as the Ape would have Cheſnuts out of the fire, without burning their own fingers, and therefore makes uſe of the Cats foot to pull them out. They would have Indulged Miniſters giving plain Teſtimonies to the Magiſtrates face, but all their own Teſtimonies are given behind the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates back, and they look rather like Satyrick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives, and railing accuſations, than the Goſpel-Teſtimonies of Goſpel-Miniſters, who ſhould with meekneſs Inſtruct, even thoſe who oppoſe themſelves, if God peradventure will give them Repentance; and who ſhould not do any thing, that really tends to harden or irritate; but do all things that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of God, to mollifie the hearts, even of theſe who oppoſe themſelves. Their way puts me in mind of the way of ſome freſh-water Souldiers, who when they are called to fight and ſhoot, have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heart nor hand to draw or preſent their Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, let be to give fire, but flees as faſt and far as their feet will carry them; and when they are at a great diſtance, they give brave fire, and ſhoots abundance of great volleys at the wind; and if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Report of theſe volleys they be enquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they diſappear, <hi>nuſquam apparent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Hiſtorian ſhuts up this matter by deſiring the Informer to tell him, <hi>If he think not, that more plain, clear, and full expreſſions might have been fallen on. Anſw.</hi> Here he ſeems to grant that their expreſſions were plain, clear, and full; for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative ſuppoſes the poſitive; and muſt honeſt men be condemned of Treachery, becauſe they fell not
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:40126:233"/> upon the plaineſt words and fulleſt expreſſions? Muſt there be Confuſion and Treachery in every Teſtimony that is not clear in the ſuperlative de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree? Theſe Brethren uſed the expreſſions, which Divines who writ moſt deliberately, and diſtinctly, and ſoundly in theſe matters, uſe; and I am very confident if they had known clearer expreſſions to have expreſt their mind, in that matter, they would have uſed them.</p>

                  </gap> fallen upon more diſtinct words, for any thing Is remember. For the words which he ſuggeſts, <hi>pag.</hi> 75. where he ſays, <hi>Why was it not more diſtinctly, and in fewer words ſaid, that they could not receive the Inſtructions, as being intrinſecally and formally Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, Regulating them, who were the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt in theſe matters.</hi> For 1. Though this had been diſtinct, yet it would not have been true; for by his own confeſſion, the confinement was wholly Political. 2. It's confuſed, at leaſt, I do not diſtinctly underſtand what matters theſe matters are, which are in the end of his diſtinct words; no doubt, theſe words mean matters, but what matters he means, I can hardly imagine. If he had ſpoken before of the matters of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> did, it would have been clear; but there is no matters before in his Speech, but the Councils Inſtructions, and a deſcription of them; now if theſe matters have not a reference to theſe Inſtructions, they have a reference to nothing, that the hearer or reader of them can underſtand, though the matters he meant might be diſtinct enough in his own mind, they could not be diſtinctly taken
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:40126:233"/> up by his hearers or readers, except he had ſome way ſignified his mind: He is now ſpeaking of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Teſtimonies, and Teſtimonies are not given by meer thinking; ſo that the Inſtructions of the Council muſt be meant by theſe matters, or elſe they will have no ſenſe at all, that we can underſtand from his words; and words that have no ſenſe, are not diſtinct words. If by theſe matters, he means the Councils Inſtructions, then the Council might have urged them to obey theſe Inſtructions: Thus, ſeeing ye are the Servants of Chriſt, in theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, then why will ye not ſerve Chriſt, in obſerving theſe Inſtructions, or doing theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in which ye are the Servants of Chriſt? Why refuſe ye to receive theſe Inſtructions, or theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in which ye are the Servants of Chriſt? And does he not here fall in the fault, which he very unreaſonably charges Mr. <hi>H.</hi> with? He alledges, that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> in giving to the Magiſtrate a Power objectively Eccleſiaſtical, did give him a Power to make Rules intrinſecally Eccleſiaſtical, for Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating Miniſters in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry, and to give theſe very Rules, which he had ſaid, he could not receive from the Magiſtrate, there was neither Reaſon, nor ſhadow of Reaſon for charging Mr. <hi>H.</hi> with this contradiction; but the Author of the Hiſtory hath laid himſelf very open to this charge. For if theſe Inſtructions be matters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Miniſters are the Servants of Chriſt, then he hath yielded to the Magiſtrate a Power to command Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to obſerve them; for Magiſtrates may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Miniſters to ſerve Chriſt in doing theſe things, in which they are the Servants of Chriſt, If it be
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:40126:234"/> ſaid, that he meant the matters of their Miniſtry, and not the Councils Inſtructions, then his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was good, but his words were not diſtinct at all, and far leſs more diſtinct than Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. It's true, his words are ſome fewer, that he leaves out ſome of Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. words, but they are ſo much the worſe and confuſed, and by his brevity he falls in obſcurity — <hi>brevis eſſe laboro, obſcurus fio.</hi> Theſe words of his, which he preſcribes for a form, as more diſtinct and ſhort, than Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. words, are either not good Grammar, having a Relative with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Antecedent in the preceding words, to which they can relate, and ſo they are without ſenſe, I ſhall not ſay non-ſenſe, or they have a bad ſenſe in acknowledging theſe Inſtructions to be matters in which Miniſters are Chriſts Servants; and ſuch a fault in Morality was large worſe than a Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical failing in ſpeaking non-ſenſe: And they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve a contradiction, or they give a Reaſon why they could not receive theſe Inſtructions, which will infer the concluſion that's contradictory to their Aſſertion. But make the beſt of them that may be, they are not more diſtinct than Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. nay, for any thing that I can ſee, they are words very confuſed, and if they relate to all the Inſtructions, as I ſhewed, they are manifeſtly falſe. By the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians own confeſſion one of them had no Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Being at all, being wholly Political; and therefore they could not truly ſay of all of them, that they could not receive them, as being Rules intrinſecally, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is ſtrange that the Hiſtorian, who is here finding fault with the Indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters words, as a diſ-ingenuous, indiſtinct, confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:40126:234"/> 
                  <hi>cothurnus,</hi> could not ſpeak more truly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly himſelf; he who would teach others to ſpeak, ſhould have learned his Grammar better; and he who blames honeſt men for diſ-ingenuity, ſhould not have endeavoured to put a lie in their mouth; and that even in the form of ſpeech, which he preſcribes as more diſtinct, he ſhould be ſo very confuſed, is a very ſtrange thing. The more I examine the Hiſtorians quibblings againſt theſe Brethrens words before the Council, I think the more of theſe Brethrens words, and am confirmed that the Lord was with their mouth, and gave them what to ſpeak; and I am the more confirmed in this, by obſerving that this Hiſtorian could not mend what they ſaid, without falling into a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt falſhood, and into a form of ſpeech, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is non-ſenſe, or hath an ill ſenſe, and deſtroys it ſelf, by giving a Reaſon in the end of the ſpeech, for refuſing the Inſtructions, which doth prove that they ſhould not be refuſed, and ſo the end de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the beginning of it.</p>
               <p>And thus the integrity and faithfulneſs of theſe Miniſters is cleared; and whether or not all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and Quibblings of the Hiſtorian againſt their acceptance of the peaceable exerciſe of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and againſt their Speeches before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, be not ſufficiently, if not ſuperabundantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, I leave it to the impartial judgment of the judicious Reader.</p>
               <p>The Brother who hath Anſwered this Hiſtory, hath ſhewed the falſhood of the two Obſervations which the Hiſtorian makes, <hi>pag.</hi> 56. by ſhewing, <hi>That upon the call of the Congregation of</hi> Irwin, <hi>that
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:40126:235"/> Reverend Brother (after his Confinement was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Council, upon the ſupplication of the ſaid Congregation) did remove to</hi> Irwin. And that the Act of Council, which came to that Miniſters hand, made no mention of the Inſtructions. So that his ſeeing that the Act of Council is the All and onely ground of tranſportation, and that the Inſtructions always go with the Indulgence, are two other of his falſe Viſions.</p>
               <p>And thus I have conſidered all the Hiſtorians Reaſons againſt the acceptance of the Indulgence, and diſcovered their unreaſonableneſs, and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered his Anſwers to theſe Objections, which he was pleaſed to propoſe to himſelf, and have found his Anſwers to be indeed no Anſwers. I have alſo examined all his quibblings againſt the Speeches of theſe of the Indulged Miniſters, who appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Council; and have diſcovered how vain they are, and I refer it to the judgment of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Reader, if I have paſſed any thing in his Arguings, that had any appearance or ſhadow of Reaſon. I am ſo far from apprehending that the judicious Reader will cenſure me for omitting any thing which deſerved an Anſwer, that upon the contrary, I fear, I ſhall be cenſured by the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, for refuting many things which are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly falſe, that they did not deſerve to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed. I ſhall onely deſire ſuch to conſider, that many things which are manifeſtly falſe, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear true to thoſe who are weak, and who have not their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern both good and evil: And ſo that which is needleſs to the ſtrong, may be neceſſary for thoſe who are weak.</p>
               <pb n="477" facs="tcp:40126:235"/>
               <p>It remains that I examine his Vindication of ſuch as ſcruple to hear and own the Indulged Miniſters, which begins <hi>pag.</hi> 128. and continues to the end of his Book. He makes ſome faſhion here of ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Queſtion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He grants, <hi>That the Indulged Miniſters are Miniſters of the Goſpel.</hi> And in his 28 Queſtions (which were as vant-couriers ſent before this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, where the main body of his forces are drawn up) he ſays, <hi>he chearfully grants them to be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and nothing doubts, but the people would willingly hear theſe ſame Indulged men, if they would relinquiſh the Indulgence, and go to the fields and Preach with the reſt.</hi> He ſays here, <hi>That he doth not make this the Queſtion, whether or not theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Miniſters are true Miniſters of the Goſpel, or ought in any caſe to be acknowledged and looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as ſuch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He grants, <hi>That it is not ſimply unlawful to hear theſe Indulged.</hi> In his 28 Queſtions he ſays, <hi>He durſt not ſay, that it were ſimply unlawful to hear the Curats.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. He grants, <hi>That they may be lawfully heard at ſome time, and in ſome Circumſtances; as for example, if there were no other to be heard in all</hi> Scotland. In his 28 queſtions he ſays, <hi>I ſhould readily grant, that in ſome caſes, and in ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, they might not onely be Lawfully heard, and joyned with, but alſo ſhould and ought be heard: As for example, if there were no other in all Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to be heard but ſuch as were ſettled by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils Orders. And I would</hi> (ſays he) <hi>yield as much even as to the Curats, I mean ſuch of them as were
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:40126:236"/> not openly flagitious and profane, or are not notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ignorant. If there were no other in all</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>to be heard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reaſon moving him to make theſe conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, is, that they have the eſſentials of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Office, and ſo their Miniſterial Actings are valid, and are not nullities; for ſo ſays he, if they are not Miniſters, all the Children whom they have Baptized are yet unbaptized; and all their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Acts are null: And to evite this Abſurdity, he will not ſay, that they are not Miniſters. We have heard what he grants, let us hear what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. 1. He denies, <hi>That the People among whom the Indulged Miniſters are ſettled, are to own theſe Miniſters as their Miniſters, their Paſtours or Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers, ſet over them by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> 2. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, <hi>That it's Lawful and expedient to hear them, when there are other Miniſters in</hi> Scotland <hi>to be heard.</hi> Then he affirms, <hi>That it is theſe Peoples Duty to withdraw from the Indulged to hear and countenance other Miniſters, who are not Indulged;</hi> and he inſinuates Reaſons, why they are to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from the one, and countenance the other. 1. <hi>The Non-indulged Preach upon Chriſts call, but the Indulged Preach not upon Chriſts call, but by mans Order. The Indulged Miniſters are not over the People in the Lord, are not ſet over them to be their Paſtours and Overſeers by the Holy Ghoſt, but the Non-indulged are over them in the Lord, and ſet over them as Paſtours and Overſeers by the Holy Ghoſt. The Non-indulged Preach contrary to mans Order,</hi> or as it is in his 28 queſtions, <hi>they Preach upon the call of Chriſt, and not upon the Warrant
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:40126:236"/> and Order of the Council, but contrary thereto; but the Indulged Preach not contrary to the Warrant and Order of the Council. There are not ſuch exceptions againſt the Non-indulged, as there are againſt the Indulged. The Non-indulged are owned and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced of the Lord in a remarkable and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner. The Indulged are not ſo countenanced,</hi> &amp;c. Though he do not expreſly deny all to the Indulged, which he aſcribes to the Non-indulged; and though he do not expreſly aſcribe to the Non-indulged, what he denies to the Indulged; yet, ſeeing he is making a compariſon to ſhew the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the Indulged and not Indulged; and ſeeing he is in this comparative balancing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged and not Indulged, whatever he puts, as pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous and advantageous in the one Scale, he muſt keep it out of the other; and upon the contrary, what is wanting or naught in the one, muſt be, or be right in the other, or elſe his compariſon would not be fair, and his Weights and Balance falſe.</p>
               <p>Thus we have the ſtate of the Queſtion before us, let us examine how it ſtands, and if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Hiſtorians tenets. 1. He grants the Indulged Miniſters to be Miniſters of the Goſpel; then his own mouth condemns him, for if they be Miniſters of the Goſpel, they have not renounced their Miniſterial miſſion and their dependance upon Chriſt: And therefore the Hiſtorian grants, that he ſaid falſe, when he ſaid they had done ſo. They who renounce that which eſſentially conſtitutes the Miniſterial Office, they are not Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and they who are Miniſters of the Goſpel, have not renounced what is eſſentially conſtitutive of the
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:40126:237"/> Goſpel-Miniſtry. Thus the Hiſtorian hath eaten in all theſe horrid calumnies of this nature, which in his Letters and this Hiſtory he hath caſt upon the Indulged Miniſters. 2. If they be Miniſters of the Goſpel, they ought to Preach the Goſpel: But this Hiſtorian ſays, they ſhould not Preach; for he ſays, none ſhould hear them, but all ſhould withdraw from them; and thus they ſhould Preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, becauſe they are Miniſters of the Goſpel, and they ſhould not Preach, becauſe none ſhould hear them, and Miniſters are not obliged to Preach, where there are none to hear, and when none ſhould hear: And thus he makes them Miniſters and no Miniſters; for a Miniſter who ſhould Preach, and whom none ſhould hear, is a Miniſter and no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter. He grants that the Miniſterial Acts, which they have done, are valid, they are not nullities; but if this Hiſtorian get his will, they ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacitate to Baptize, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> any more; and thus he turns them into meer inſignificant cyphers. The onely comfort in this ſad caſe is, that if they will but come out of the Kirk to the Fields, and ſo change the place of their Preaching, they ſhall make as ſignificant figures as the Non-indulged: For he who is but a cypher in the Kirk, will make a great figure in the Fields, though he ſtand there alone, and no other Miniſter be with him: This is a new Arithmetical invention, to make a cypher, which ſignified nothing, by a meer local removal, to become a very ſignificant figure, though no fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure be prefixed to it, to add any virtue to it. I wonder whence it comes, that the Fields and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in <hi>Scotland</hi> have ſuch virtue, and have it not
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:40126:237"/> in any other part of the World, that we hear of; for in <hi>Scotland,</hi> according to this Authors Opinion, a Miniſter who ſignifies nothing in a Kirk, where the Magiſtrate allows him the peaceable exerciſe of his Miniſtry, if he will take the Fields, he ſhall not only be a man, a Miniſter in the Fields, but chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully heard, and countenanced, and owned, not onely of men, but of the Lord in a wonderful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: And the Bleſſing which was with-held from the People in the Kirk, juſtly becauſe of their ſin, they ſhall find it in the Fields, notwithſtanding of their provocations. See <hi>pag.</hi> 133. Or if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thought that the Fields had this force every where, I wonder how he did not take the Fields in <hi>Holland,</hi> where they ſay the Magiſtrate claims more Power, in reference to matters of Religion, than the Hiſtorian allows; but on the contrary, he ſtayed with in the Kirk, as long as the Magiſtrate allowed, &amp; even when the Magiſtrate would not ſuffer him to Preach in the Kirk, he never went to the Fields, for any thing we could hear, but kept himſelf within doors. I ſee the change of places makes a change in ſome mens minds, and therefore that doth not hold always: <hi>Coelum non animum mutant, qui trans mare currunt,</hi> And that the Fellow who ſaid, <hi>Si tu hic eſſes, aliter ſentires,</hi> was not altogether ſenſeleſs.</p>
               <p>But again, if the Indulged Miniſters be Miniſters of the Goſpel, and do indeed Preach the Goſpel, then the People who received them as their own Miniſters, formerly ordained by the Presbytery to take the charge of them; or who in their deſtitute condition, invited them as Miniſters, ordained, to come and Preach the Goſpel to them, are obliged
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:40126:238"/> to own them as Miniſters of the Goſpel, and to countenance them in Preaching, and if they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from them, and break off that Communion in the publick pure Worſhip of God in which they formerly joyned, they are guilty not only of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, in deſerting the Miniſters of the Goſpel, who come upon their invitation, to help them in their deſtitute condition, but they are guilty of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration or Schiſm.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He grants, <hi>That it is not ſimply ſinful to hear the Indulged Miniſters.</hi> Then he ſaid falſe, when he ſaid, <hi>Theſe Miniſters were not Chriſts Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, for to hear theſe, as Miniſters, as Chriſts Ambaſſadours, who are not ſent by him, but ſent by men Uſurping Chriſts Authority, were ſimply ſinful, if they have renounced their dependance on Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. 2. And he ſpeaks a groſs untruth, when he ſays, <hi>That the hearing of Indulged Miniſters is an homologating, countenancing, approving of a ſinful Supremacy, and that the hearing of Curats is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of Prelacy; for the approving of that which is ſinful, and in its own nature ſinful, is ſimply ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; the approving of that which is in it ſelf ill, and always and at all times evil, that is, not only now and then, but always, and in all caſes ſinful, and ſimply ſinful.</hi> 3. He grants, <hi>That if there were no other Miniſters in</hi> Scotland, <hi>that none would ſcruple to hear the Prelates Curates:</hi> And in his 28 que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, <hi>That in that caſe not only might the Indulged and the Curats be heard, but they ſhould and ought to be heard.</hi> Then he muſt quit that conceit, that the hearing of Indulged Miniſters, and of Curats, is an approbation of ſinful Supremacy and Prelacy;
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:40126:238"/> for men ſhould never approve that which is in its ſelf evil. 2. He miſerably torments the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the poor ſimple People, who will believe him; for he tells them, it's unlawful to hear Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſters while there are others in <hi>Scotland</hi> to be heard; but if there be no others, then it's not only Lawful, but a Duty to hear the Indulged Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters: So that the People, in Order to the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this caſe of Conſcience, whether they do right or wrong in hearing or not hearing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Miniſters, they muſt inform themſelves, whether there be any other Miniſter alive in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and ſo long as they hear there is any one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, though he were living in the <hi>Mull</hi> of <hi>Galloway,</hi> and they were living at <hi>John a Grots,</hi> it were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them to hear Indulged Miniſters; but if he were dead, it were a ſin not to hear: And ſo the People would be in Conſcience obliged to keep up a conſtant Intelligence, that they might know how ſoon that Miniſter died, that they might not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their Duty in hearing Indulged Miniſters. His advice to hear the Curats or Indulged Miniſters, in caſe there were no other to hear, comes too late to the People whom he commends for their leading of Miniſters, arid breaking the ice, for they are far before him here; for they will chooſe rather to hear none at all, than to hear either Biſhops Curats, or Council-Curats; and ſome of them ſay, they like the laſt worſe than the firſt: And if the Hiſtorian were living, there are ſome of theſe People who would not hear himſelf, if they knew he were of that Opinion, that either Indulged Miniſters or Curats ſhould be heard in any caſe. Some of them
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:40126:239"/> would tell him, that he is all miſtaken, when l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t thinks that the Baptiſm adminiſtred by Curats is valid, and is not a nullity; for they judge it to be much worſe than a nullity, to be even the mark of the Beaſt. And ſeeing he acknowledges the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for Guides, he muſt follow them, they will not come back to him; if he cry after them, that he meant not flagitious and ignorant Curats, but thoſe who are knowing and of ſober converſations, they will cry back, we who are common People, are not for diſtinctions, as ye your ſelf ſaid: We will hear none of them in no caſe; whole Sale is good Sale: And therefore follow us, who have guided you, who are Miniſters, now a long time, and ye your ſelf have commended us for good Guides, and if ye will not follow us, we and you will ſhed, for ye are ſlipped aſide, we are where we were, ye are fallen off, and ſo we are not to be blamed for the breach. And if the Hiſtorian have no other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for hearing the Indulged, or the Conformiſts, when folk can do no other ways but that which he mentions, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſhunning of that abſurdity, that if they were no Miniſters, their Baptiſms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would be nullities, and the Children were unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized: If this be all, it may be made uſe of to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the People in a miſter to hear a Popiſh Prieſt, for the Baptiſm that he adminiſters is not a nullity, and Papiſts when they turn Proteſtants, are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized; and where away this will lead, let any who have any diſcerning in theſe matters, judge.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons for which he would have the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with-drawing, are, 1. <hi>That they are not called by Chriſt, nor ſet over the People by the Holy Ghoſt,
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:40126:239"/> but by the Council.</hi> If it be reduced to form, and candidly propoſed, it muſt run thus: The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil permitted and allowed the Indulged Miniſters the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry, in ſuch and ſuch Congregations, and therefore they were not called by Chriſt, nor ſet over theſe Congregations by the Holy Ghoſt: The conſequence is manifeſtly falſe, for if the Magiſtrates Civil allowance of the publick peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry, do make void the poteſtative miſſion, which Miniſters have from Chriſt, in their Ordination; and if it deſtroys the Peoples invitation, and the advice and conſent of Miniſters concerned, all which the Indulged Miniſters had, as hath been ſhewed before; then it will follow, that where ever the Magiſtrate permits, allows, appoints Miniſters to Preach, that there there are no Miniſters called by Chriſt, or ſet over Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by the Holy Ghoſt; and of what pernicious conſequence this is, and how deſtructive to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Goſpel in all places of the World, where the Magiſtrate allows of it, any may ſee with half an eye. Again, may not the People of theſe Congregations reaſon thus, if theſe Miniſters, who either were Ordained our Miniſters by the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, or thoſe whom we in our deſtitute condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did invite to come and help us, and who came with the advice and conſent of the generality of the Miniſters, which was all could be expected in ſuch a broken time for ſetting them among us, and applying their Miniſtry to us for a time: If theſe be not our Miniſters, then certainly there are none whom we can call our Miniſters. Is not this the way to ſhake theſe People looſe of all relation to any
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:40126:240"/> Miniſters, as their Miniſters, or as ſent by Chriſt to them. If the Hiſtorian will not deny that the Miniſters not Indulged are called of Chriſt to Preach to the People who are not of the Congregations where they were formerly Miniſters, why ſhould he deny this to the Indulged Miniſters, who have much more to make up a Relation betwixt them and theſe People, than they have to make up a Relation betwixt them and other Miniſters, whom it may be they never heard nor ſaw before, and are not ſure whether they be Miniſters or not? Such wild fancies as this Author and others have ſuggeſted to the People, have brought ſome to that, that they have reſpect to no Miniſters, and others care for none, except one or two, of whom others who are more diſcerning, are much aſhamed.</p>
               <p>As for that Reaſon, that Indulged Miniſters Preach according to mans Order, and the not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Preach not upon the Warrant and Order of the Council, but contrary thereunto. If it be truly propoſed, it muſt run thus: The Indulged have a Civil Order or Warrant for the peacable exerciſe of their Miniſtry, and ſo their Preaching in theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes to which they are Indulged, is not contrary to the Magiſtrates will, ſeeing the Magiſtrate allows them to Preach in theſe places, and therefore Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are to withdraw from hearing them, that they may countenance theſe Miniſters, who have no ſuch Civil Warrant for the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry, but Preaches contrary to the Magiſtrates will. Now what Reaſon is in this, that the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſters ſhould be diſcountenanced and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, becauſe the Magiſtrate allows them the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:40126:240"/> exerciſe of their Miniſtry, and that theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſhould onely be heard, who Preach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Magiſtrates will: The Indulged were as far from receiving their Miniſtry or Inſtructions to Regulate them in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry, as the not Indulged were. This was the difference, that the Magiſtrate did countenance or allow the Preaching of the Indulged, and diſcountenance and diſallow the Preaching of the Non-indulged; and ſhould the Indulged be diſcountenanced, becauſe the Magiſtrate did permit and allow their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? This bewrays a great diſreſpect to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate: Why would not the Author try this in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and with ſome of his Proſelytes have taken the Fields, and called away the People from the Miniſters, who were countenanced by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, to hear them who Preached without and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Magiſtrates Order. The People might have countenanced the Non-indulged, and yet not deſerted the Indulged; for there were many other places beſides Indulged Pariſhes, who deſired the help of outed Miniſters, and the countenance of the People, who deſerted Indulged Miniſters, did not continue towards the Non-indulged, who would not humour them in all things, and hold up their yeas and nays; and as ſoon as any of theſe outed Miniſters began to ſignifie their inclination to have the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry under the Protection of Lawful Authority, theſe People who meaſured Miniſters faithfulneſs by their Preaching contrary to the Magiſtrates will, did caſt at them as Apoſtates. This I ſuppoſe is a new Teſt for trying what Miniſters are called of Chriſt, which
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:40126:241"/> hath not been before this heard in the Reformed Churches, <hi>viz.</hi> They whom the Magiſtrate allows to Preach, they are not called of Chriſt, and are to be withdrawn from; they who Preach contrary to the Magiſtrates will, they are called of Chriſt, and to be countenanced: But it is a deteſtable teſt, for it would caſt all the Miniſters of the Goſpel through the World, who have the countenance and protection of Lawful Authority. But though this Teſt had neither Foundation in Scripture, nor Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, being contrary to both; yet it was pretty well calculate for the new Common-wealth, which was to be raiſed upon the Ruines of the preſent Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates. As for that Reaſon, that there are not ſuch exceptions againſt the Non-indulged as againſt the Indulged: I have ſhewed before, that the excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the Indulged are calumnies, and if Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſhall be caſt and deſerted upon calumnies, it's an eaſie thing to depoſe them all. It hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the beſt Miniſters have been moſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate, and they whom the Lord put in greateſt capacity to do him Service, the Devil and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments did caſt moſt filthy calumnies at ſuch; how many calumnies were caſt upon our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, the chief Shepherd, when he was Miniſter of the Circumciſion: Many exceptions were made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Paul,</hi> the choſen veſſel of Chriſt. <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> was horribly calumniate by the <hi>Arrians.</hi> As for what he ſays of the wonderful ſucceſs of the Non-indulged, and rich Bleſſing attending their Miniſtry, it hath been obſerved by many who were not Indulged, that the Lord bleſſed the Miniſtry of theſe not Indulged Miniſters, who made it their
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:40126:241"/> buſineſs to Preach the Goſpel, and to teach the things which made for Peace and Edification; but as for thoſe few, who made it their buſineſs to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the People, and draw them away from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Miniſters, that they left the People worſe than they found them: For the People who liſtned to them, became more careleſs or learning the grounds of Religion, and had little heart to any thing but theſe jangling Debates, which did not tend to Edification, but Diviſion and Confuſion; and that they become more vain, and ſelf-conceited, and cenſorious, and ſome of them become great and manifeſt lyars, and calumniators, and of a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter invective diſpoſition. And if tryal be made in theſe Pariſhes, where the Indulged Miniſters are, it will be found, that theſe deſerters of the Miniſtry of the Indulged Miniſters, are far inferiour in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, love, diligence to others who have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly countenanced the Miniſtry of Indulged Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. But this Reaſon of deſerting the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſters, is alſo of moſt dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and would break the beſt conſtituted Church of the World, if it were reduced to practice, and therefore the general Aſſembly of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> made an Act againſt ſuch as withdraw themſelves from the publick Worſhip in their own Congregations; and this Act was made, as appears in the Act it ſelf, for preſerving Order, Unity, and Peace in the Kirk, for maintaining that Reſpect which is due to the Ordinances and Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, for preventing Schiſm, noiſom Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and all unlawful Practiſes, which may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low on the Peoples withdrawing themſelves from
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:40126:242"/> their own Congregations. And any may ſee, that if People ought to go to theſe Miniſters, who are moſt eminent for gifts, grace, utterance, ſucceſs; then all the Congregations of Miniſters, who are leſs eminent for gifts and graces, and have leſs ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in their Miniſtry, would be quite diſſolved. And oft-times weak Miniſters have more ſucceſs in their Miniſtry, than thoſe who are every way more eminent, as to gifts and graces: Is not the great Paſtor of all Paſtors brought in by the Prophet, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretting he had laboured in vain? Had ever Chriſt in the days of his fleſh ſuch ſucceſs as <hi>Peter</hi> had in one Sermon? <hi>Acts</hi> 2. Mr. <hi>Rutherfurd,</hi> in his <hi>Due right of Presbytery,</hi> ſhews, that even the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents would not allow of a Separation from a Congregation where all the Ordinances of Chriſt are, though the Miniſters were leſs Powerful and Spiritual, to another Congregation, where incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably there is a more Powerful and more Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Miniſtry, <hi>pag.</hi> 74. the Independents alledged, that it was the want of ſomething which Chriſt commanded, which cauſed them ſeparate. To which Mr. <hi>Rutherfurd,</hi> after ſeveral other things, anſwers, <hi>pag.</hi> 72. That it is not Chriſts command, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.10. to ſeparate from theſe Churches, and to renounce all communion with them, becauſe theſe, who ſat in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair did neglect many Ordinances of Chriſt; for when they gave the falſe meaning of the Law, they ſtole away the Law, and ſo a principal Ordinance of God: and yet Chriſt I believe forbad Separation, when he commanded that they ſhould hear them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. But the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents were not ſo in love with Separation, as
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:40126:242"/> to allow Separation from a Church, where all the Lords Ordinances might be enjoyed in Purity, though not in ſo Powerful a manner as in another Congregation. The Hiſtorian dare not deny the Indulged to be Miniſters of the Goſpel, he dare not ſay, that the Ordinances are not diſpenſed by them in Purity, according to Chriſts Inſtitution; he dare not ſay, that there are any of Chriſts Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances wanting in the Kirks, which are to be had in the Fields; he dare not ſay, that any thing ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is required, as a condition of Church-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the Congregations where Indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Preach; he dare not ſay, that theſe Indulged Miniſters did intrude themſelves upon theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations againſt the will of the People, for they were invited to come, and the People evidenced their conſent to their coming, by a chearful atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the Ordinances diſpenſed by theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters: and yet he concludes, that it's unlawful for the People to hear them, and that it's their Duty to break off from that Church-communion and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, in which they did formerly joyn with them; for he preſſes withdrawing: And he makes this withdrawing from the Indulged Miniſters, which is ſo eaſie to every profane Perſon, as he is profane, to be the Duty of a neceſſary Teſtimony againſt ſinful Uſurpations; and ſo theſe profane Perſons, who profanely withdraws from the Lords Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in which they never had any delight, and are glad of any pretext for abſenting themſelves, are put in conceit that their profanity makes them Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, or Witneſſes to the Truth, and againſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Uſurpations. Any may ſee from his ſtating of
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:40126:243"/> the Queſtion, that he hath been miſerably confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and perplexed. In one of his Letters he ſays, <hi>There is ſin wrapt up in hearing the Indulged,</hi> which would ſeem to make the hearing of them intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and ſo ſimply ſinful; here he makes it onely unlawful, by reaſon of ſome Circumſtances, and that which he gives as a Circumſtance, is one of the oddeſt Circumſtances that ye have readily heard of; it ſtands ſo far off, and at ſo great a diſtance from hearing, that it's a wonder how it ſhould have any influence to change it in its Morality. He ſays, it's unlawful to hear the Indulged while there are any other Miniſters in all <hi>Scotland</hi> to hear; but when there are no other, then it's not onely Lawful, but it's Duty to hear; that then not onely they may be heard, but they ſhould be heard: It's ſtrange, that the Life of a Miniſter living, it may be 40, 50 miles from People, who live in places where In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Miniſters are, ſhould make their hearing of theſe Indulged Miniſters unlawful, and then his death ſhould make it Duty. Seeing he was of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that ſuch remote Circumſtances, which come not near by many miles, make this change in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it was a very ill wailed expreſſion which he uſed in his Letter, <hi>viz. That ſin was wrapt up in hearing the Indulged:</hi> It had been mare conſonant to this unlawfulneſs, which ariſes from Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are ſo remote, that they cannot be ſo much as called adjacent, they lie ſo far off, and keep at ſuch a diſtance from the Perſon who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to know whether his hearing be ſin or Duty, that though he keep up a moſt exact Intelligence, it will be two or three days ere he can hear of the
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:40126:243"/> Circumſtance that alters the nature of his hearing the Indulged Miniſters. I ſay, it had been more conſonant to ſuch a circumſtantial unlawfulneſs, to have ſaid, that ſin was wrapped about it, or rather that it was wrapped up at a great diſtance from it, than that ſin was wrapped up in it: For ſeeing he had a mind that this unlawfulneſs ſhould be taken off by the change of ſome very extrinſecal things, he did fooliſhly to put this unlawfulneſs within, for it is not ſo eaſie to pick out what is within, as to ſlip off that which is without. I heard from a grave and judicious Miniſter, who had occaſion to meet with one of the young men, who Preached confidently what this Hiſtorian wrote, that that Youth kept to this expreſſion, <hi>That ſin was wrapt up in hearing Indulged Miniſters,</hi> as if it had been his Text; and the poor People drunk in this Schiſmatick poiſon, and it hath taken with their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that in all appearance, though the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian were alive, and would write a hundred Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and print twenty Books, and declare in them, that there is no ſin wrapt up in hearing Indulged Miniſters, theſe People would not believe him, but would adhere to his firſt Letter: It's an eaſie thing to drop in the poiſon of Error and Schiſm in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Peoples heads, and hearts, but it's not ſo eaſie to purge it out again: It's eaſie to beget prejudices againſt Gods Ordinances, and draw People from the Kirk, but it's not ſo eaſie to remove theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, and bring them again to the Ordinances. The Heart is naturally corrupt, and corrupt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines are kindly to it, and it takes well with them, and they with it: And Error is like a fretting gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green,
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:40126:244"/> the longer it continues, it rots and ſpreads the more. And it's obſerved, that when People drinks in erroneous Doctrines, upon the bare word of theſe, who teach Diviſion, and their heart and affection takes with Error, though they have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhadow of Scripture or Reaſon for it, that they are hardly recovered from theſe deluſions; for Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who are miſled by ſome wreſted Scripture, or captious Reaſoning, they may be more eaſily reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, by ſhewing the true meaning of the wreſted and miſ-applyed Scripture, and the captiouſneſs of the falſe Reaſoning. But when People will err, and love to wander, and will ſtumble, though they wot not at what, and are ſo affectionately addicted to their erroneous Opinions, that they will hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that makes againſt them, there is little proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Cure; for as they received them without Reaſon, becauſe they would receive them, ſo they retain them againſt Reaſon, and cannot endure to have theſe beloved tenets brought under examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and tryal, and therefore they readily flee out in Paſſion, upon any who would inform them; as mens Luſts are their Idols, ſo are their Errors, when they are once ſettled in their hearts. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid, that his error was his God, <hi>Error meus erat Deus meus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if this Hiſtorian, who was a man of letters, be ſo confounded and confuſed in ſtating this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and is involved in groſs contradictions, what wonder, if the poor people, who are not fit for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, be whirled round by ſuch whirl-winds, and contrary winds, into a confuſed giddineſs, that they wot not what they ſay, or affirm, and know not
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:40126:244"/> what to do; and be like Children, that have ſo long run about, that they fall down, as unable to ſtand or move any more: So they are ſo confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with theſe perplexed Queſtions about hearing; which cannot be propounded, and far leſs reſolved, without manifeſt Abſurdities and Contradictions, that many of them are fallen over in a careleſs la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zineſs and indifferency about all hearing of the Word, and ſpends the Lords day in ſleeping, loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, and idle wandring.</p>
               <p>The Hiſtorian doth but waſte time and paper, when he ſays, that in our beſt times, People were not ſo tyed to the hearing of their Miniſters, as that they might never, or in no caſe hear others; for that is not the Queſtion: But this is the true ſtate of the Queſtion, <hi>Whether People who have theſe Miniſters to hear, who were formerly Ordained by the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery, to be their Paſtors, and thoſe who have theſe Miniſters to hear, whom they invited to come and help them, when they were deſtitute, and had none to Preach to them? If theſe People who have conſented to receive the Lords Ordinances from theſe Miniſters, and have waited on their Miniſtry, and joyned with them in the Lords Worſhip, if they ought to break off that Church-fellowſhip, and though they acknowledge theſe Miniſters to be Miniſters of the Goſpel, and though theſe Miniſters Preach the Goſpel, and diſpenſe the Lords Ordinances, according to the Lords Inſtitution, yet if they ought to withdraw conſtantly from hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and that becauſe it's unlawful to hear them, and there is ſin wrapt up in hearing them, and that they are called of God to withdraw, that
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:40126:245"/> in doing ſo, they may bear witneſs againſt the ſinful Uſurpations manifeſt in the Indulgence, and the many evils in accepting it;</hi> or more ſhortly, <hi>If it be ſin for theſe People to hear theſe Miniſters, and if it be their Duty to deſert them, and ſeparate themſelves from theſe Congregations where they exerciſe their Miniſtry.</hi> This Hiſtorian ſeemeth to be for the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative, and ſo confident that theſe People do right in withdrawing, that he ſays, <hi>One might think it ſtrange, that there ſhould be any neceſſity to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate them, conſidering what he hath ſaid above.</hi> I am one of theſe, who have conſidered what he hath ſaid above, and I thought it very ſtrange how he could vent ſuch groſs and manifeſtly falſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies againſt faithful Miniſters, and how he could wreſt and pervert their true, right, honeſt words, contrary to common ſenſe and equity; that he might wring out of them that which never entred in the thoughts or heart of theſe Miniſters. And again, I think it ſtrange, that by theſe falſe and groundleſs Calumnies which he hath caſt upon theſe honeſt Miniſters, he ſhould labour to rent the Church of God by Schiſm, by breaking theſe who will li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten to him, off from communicating with the true Church in the true Worſhip of God, and by preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to diſown and deſert theſe Miniſters, whom they formerly owned and countenanced, and whom they are ſtill obliged to own, and have no juſt cauſe to deſert, except his falſe Calumnies be accounted juſt cauſes.</p>
               <p>Having obſerved the confuſion and contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in which the Hiſtorian hath involved himſelf in ſtating the Queſtion, it remains to conſider, what
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:40126:245"/> he ſays for the vindication of theſe who ſcruple to hear and own the Indulged Miniſters. But ſeeing he ſays nothing but what he hath ſaid before, and is formerly refuted, I hope the Reader will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that I ſhould play the goke, in repeating again his Cuckows, and refuting them, although I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him before in his extravagant wandrings; when he without, and contrary to all ſenſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, imagined that this or that, or the other thing was the meaning of the Indulged Miniſters words; yet I cannot have any pretext for making meer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions in his wandrings, there was variety of vain imaginations, which made the refutation of them leſs tedious, but to repeat the ſame things to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe but to waſte time and paper, would be intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably tedious and nauſeating. I ſhall onely by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering his firſt Queſtion, ſhew the way of anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſt. 1. <hi>Seeing by what is ſaid under our firſt head of Arguments,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Seeing by what is ſaid, in anſwer to your firſt head of Arguments, it is manifeſt that the Indulged, in and by their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of the Indulgence, have not wronged our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is the onely Head of the Church, and King in <hi>Zion,</hi> in any of theſe nine ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral particulars (which are nine ſeveral Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, the ordinary Arguments which he makes uſe of againſt the Indulged Miniſters, for he could find no true Arguments to his purpoſe againſt them.) How can they but be blamed, who out of a ſinful credulity, make up or take up ſuch vile Reproaches againſt faithful Miniſters, and then out of theſe Calumnies create to themſelves ſcruples, which ſcare them from hearing theſe whom the Lord hath ſent
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:40126:246"/> to Preach the Goſpel to them. And ſo through the reſt of his Queſtions, where he refers to his heads of Arguments, I refer to the Anſwers, which cuts off both heads and tails of theſe captions.</p>
               <p>As for the Arguments taken out of the late Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, which, contrary to the intention of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſt, he abuſes (for he perverts the words both of the dead and living) they make nothing againſt the hearing of the Indulged Miniſters; (let the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts ſay for themſelves) for the applications which the Hiſtorian makes to the Indulged, are manifeſtly falſe, as hath been already manifeſted in Anſwering the Hiſtorians Captions and Cavils.</p>
               <p>It cannot be denyed, that ſome who have taken upon them to diſcuſs that queſtion about hearing Conformiſts, have uſed Arguments, and laid down Grounds, which are new conceits, and contrary to the Principles of the old Non-conformiſts, and tend directly to Schiſm. I ſhall onely relate ſome of the words of a Godly Learned Miniſter, who in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the 28 Queſtions, which this Hiſtorian ſent over before his Hiſtory, hath ſpoken ſomewhat with great Modeſty, to this purpoſe. In Anſwering the Hiſtorians 8th. Queſtion, after he hath ſhewed how great difference there is betwixt the Indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and the Conformiſts, he ſays, <hi>But there is one thing I would gladly enquire of him: In his</hi> Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis <hi>he ſeems to hint, that the hearing of theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters who have complyed in their own charges, where they were orderly fixed by the Church of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>is a complying with Prelacy: For my own part, I ſee not how he will inſtruct this; and if the ſinfulneſs of hearing them, upon the account of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance,
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:40126:246"/> which is their own perſonal guilt, be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. I ſee not how that Doctrine can be juſtified from owning the Principles of Separation, but I ſhall be glad to learn of him: I confeſs my judgment hitherto hath been, that it is the Duty of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſeek their Edification by Presbyterian Miniſters, whether in Houſes, Fields, or Kirks; and that it is their Duty to diſcountenance Curates of all kinds: And for intruders, I am not clear for hearing of them, except tranſiently; for it's very hard to ſay, that it's ſinful in it ſelf to hear them at any time. But for them who comply in their own charges, and Preach Orthodox Doctrine, without corrupting the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, ſo as there be no corruptions that are made the conditions of Peoples Communion, I ſee not how in that caſe it can be made out, that it is ſinful for People to hear them when they can get no better to hear, which the Author himſelf grants, in ſtating the Queſtion, and therefore is the more concerned to ſee to it. It will be neceſſary we reconcile our practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with our old Principles, for if we drink in new Principles, and once remove March ſtones, it's hard to know where we may hold; and we had need to be jealous of that new Light which drives us from our old Principles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Anſwering his 26th. Queſtion, he ſays, <hi>This is new Doctrine, that hearing of Miniſters will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve the People in the approbation of their ſinful entry: It is eaſie to aſſert ſuch things, but he will put his Reaſon upon the Rack before he prove this.</hi> 3. <hi>When he ſpeaks of the Curates, why does he confound countenancing and hearing, as he doth ſeveral times in this Paper? May not Miniſters in diſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="500" facs="tcp:40126:247"/> Ordinances without the mixtures of mens inventions, if they be true Miniſters, be heard in many caſes, without countenancing their entry and their courſe? I do wiſh from my heart, that the People in this Queſtion about hearing had been more diſtinctly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, ſo as they might guard againſt Rocks on both ſides, for I fear the neglect of this ſhall be the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of drinking in of Principles againſt, or contrary to the former Principles of the Church of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
               <p>And in the cloſe of that Anſwer, he intreats the Author of theſe 28 Queſtions, to ponder how the Doctrine which he delivers, agrees with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our Divines, againſt Separation. It is the common aſſertion of our Divines againſt Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, that where the corruptions of a Church are not made the condition of our Communion, it is not Lawful to Separate: And Mr. <hi>Rutherfurd,</hi> in his <hi>Peaceable Plea, Chap.</hi> 10. makes this the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>Whether or not it be Lawful to Separate from a true Church viſible, for the corruption of Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the wickedneſs of Paſtors and Profeſſors, where faith is begotten by the Preaching of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Truth.</hi> And through that Chapter he aſſerts and clears the Negative of that Queſtion. Alſo (ſays he) Mr. <hi>Broune,</hi> in his Book againſt <hi>Volſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> pleads againſt Separation, becauſe of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Miniſters, where Chriſts Ordinances are pure, and the Eſſence of the Miniſtry is not deſtroyed by their corruptions. And ſo, though the Indulgence had been ſinfully accepted, which yet we deny, it would not deſtroy the Eſſence of their Miniſtry, for the Hiſtorian grants they are
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:40126:247"/> true Miniſters, and he does not charge them with corrupting the Ordinances, and therefore the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian is condemned by Mr. <hi>Rutherfurd</hi> and Mr. <hi>Broune.</hi> The Non-conformiſts might have kept up all due reſpect to Presbyterian Miniſters, and conſtantly adhered to them and their Miniſtry, though that new Doctrine of the ſinfulneſs of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conformiſts had never been taught to them; but ſome folk cannot do, except they over-do; and in running from one extream ruſh upon another. I know ſome alledge, that they ſee further in theſe matters than the old Non-conformiſts did, and they think that the old Non-conformiſts in writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Separatiſts, have wronged the Cauſe. But it is not want of Ignorance that aileth ſuch People, we are far behind theſe Godly and Learned men, both in Heavenly Wiſdom, and true tenderneſs, and Zeal; and that which many take for Light and Zeal is Ignorance, Error, Humour, and the wrath of man which perfects not the Righteouſneſs of God. Any who have read what is ſaid before, will ſee that theſe Arguments of the Apologiſt does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude nothing againſt hearing the Indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, for the applications are manifeſtly falſe. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of any Indulged Miniſter, who entred into the Congregation of a living outed Miniſter, ſave one, who had the conſent of that Miniſter, who was out of the Countrey, and had no acceſs to his People. As for what the Author ſays in the application of the Apologiſts 7th. Argument, that the hearing of Indulged Miniſters is enjoyned and required by Law, as a ſign of complyance with, and ſubjecting to <hi>Eraſtianiſm,</hi> and the Supremacy,
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:40126:248"/> is ſo manifeſt an untruth, that I wonder how his Conſcience could ſuffer his hand to write it: And yet I have found ſo many falſhoods of this kind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that I need not wonder; and it were unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to expect any other Arguments againſt Truth and Innocency, and for Schiſm, but ſuch as are patched up of lies and calumnies. After all his Queſtions, I may propoſe one Queſtion, <hi>Why in his Paper ſent over before this Hiſtory, and in this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, he doth not Argue poſitively, that it's unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to hear the Indulged Miniſters, but onely moves Queſtions, if they ſhould be condemned, who do not own and hear the Indulged, as they did formerly:</hi> And after he hath done with his miſ-application of the Apologiſts Arguments, where he ſeems more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, yet he ends all with a Queſtion, which he refers to the judgment of the Reader, <hi>pag.</hi> 159. I apprehend the Hiſtorian durſt not for his Conſcience conclude, that it was ſinful to hear, or that it was a Duty to withdraw from hearing the Indulged Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; he knew, and his Conſcience put him to declare, that the acceptance of the Indulgence and the Councils Order, as he calls it, ſettling the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Miniſters, did not make it ſinful to hear theſe Miniſters, for he confeſſes, that notwithſtanding of the ſettling of theſe Miniſters by the Councils Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, yet, if there were no other to be heard, they not onely might be Lawfully heard and joyned with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they ſhould and ought to be heard. See the ſtating of the Queſtion in his 28 Queſtions. But though he durſt not poſitively conclude the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of hearing the Indulged Miniſters, yet the poor People thinks that he hath done it; and they are run
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:40126:248"/> ſo far from hearing the Indulged Miniſters, that they are without his cry to bring them back, though there were no other to hear: And too many by theſe queſtions about hearing, are become careleſs of all hearing, and ſome place their Religion in no hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It had been good for many they had never intermedled with theſe queſtions about hearing, for they are by the wind of Erroneous and Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Doctrines, driven from the Publick Worſhip of God: And they take the profanation of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath in deſpiſing the Publick Ordinances to be a piece of tenderneſs and Religion; and if the Lord prevent it not, they are like to turn Quakers, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, Atheiſts, and to ſhake off the very form of Religion, both in publick, private, and ſecret. The Lord in mercy pity and prevent the ruine that the poor People are blindly running upon.</p>
               <p>Page 159. He propoſes Objections to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
               <p>The firſt Objection ſhould have been propoſed thus. <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel, who are Ordained and admitted Miniſters of their reſpective Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and Miniſters who not having acceſs to theſe Congregations, where they were Ordained Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, are invited by deſolate vacant Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Preach the Goſpel to them, and who, upon their invitation and conſent of the Miniſters concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, come to help theſe deſtitute, deſolate Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhould not be diſowned, diſcountenanced, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, while they are doing the Work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, to which God hath called them by theſe People, who invited them to Preach the Goſpel to them: But the Indulged Miniſters were either Ordained,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="504" facs="tcp:40126:249"/> invited, and come with conſent of the Miniſters concerned,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And therefore they ſhould not be deſerted while they are doing the Work of the Lord, to which theſe reſpective Congregations invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them.</hi> If he had thus propoſed the Argument, he could not have evaded the force of it, but it is his way to make Objections ſo, as he may leave ſome way for himſelf to eſcape. The true ſtate of the Queſtion is, <hi>Whether theſe reſpective Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould diſown and reject theſe Miniſters of the Goſpel, whom they had invited, and with conſent of the Miniſters concerned, had received and appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate to themſelves, to whom they had ſubmitted, and whom they had countenanced in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry.</hi> Now, why ſhould they reject them, as if they had nothing to do with them, whom they received? Why ſhould they diſown them, whom they owned, and whom they deſired to own them? Why ſhould they withdraw from hearing theſe, whom they invited to Preach to them? Should they leave them, becauſe they Preach the Goſpel to them? While this Author calls in queſtion, if the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſters be Lawfully called, and appropriate Paſtours of this Church, he calls in queſtion, if this Church have any Paſtours; for they were Ordained by laying on of the hands of the Presbytery accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Order of the Goſpel; and if this make them not Paſtours of this Church, I would know who are Paſtours of it.</p>
               <p>As for his ſecond Objection, taken from Mr. <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingſton</hi>'s Advice to hear Mr. <hi>John Scot,</hi> an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſter, he had better forborn to mention it, than to have paſt it with ſuch Anſwers as he gives.
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:40126:249"/> Mr. <hi>Livingſton,</hi> whom he acknowledges an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Seer and Servant of Chriſt, adviſed to hear the Indulged. This Hiſtorian adviſes to withdraw from hearing the Indulged: And it's no diſparagement to the Hiſtorian, to ſay, that Mr. <hi>Livingſton</hi>'s Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was preferable to this Hiſtorians Advice, who for Learning, Piety, Prudence, Experience, and Age, was far inferiour to Mr. <hi>Livingſton:</hi> The onely thing which Mr. <hi>Livingſton</hi> miſſed, ſo far as I remember, was a Teſtimony; and if he had been well informed of the Teſtimonies which the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Brethren gave, upon ſeveral occaſions, and particularly before the Council, and of the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy of their Practice to their verbal Teſtimony, and their former Principles, he would have been much confirmed in adviſing to hear Indulged Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. The Hiſtorian ſays, that he does not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know whether this Advice of Mr. <hi>Living<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> proceeded from want of full information of Circumſtances, or from Ignorance of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates deſign, or from fear, that Field-meetings would ceaſe; but he inclines to the laſt, becauſe Mr. <hi>Livingſton</hi> ſpeaks not of his Peoples going to the Field-meetings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We have ſeen that any Light which this Hiſtorian hath gotten from Circumſtances, is dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And I am very confident, if Mr. <hi>Livingſton</hi> had lived to ſee what Erroneous and Schiſmatick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences this Hiſtorian hath made from the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation which he hath gotten of many Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and had ſeen the horrid Diviſions and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions following upon theſe Erroneous dividing Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, he would either have judged, that that
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:40126:250"/> Circumſtantial Light was darkneſs, or if it was light, that this Hiſtorian did draw darkneſs out of light. But I know no Circumſtance of any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance which could make any thing againſt the Indulgence, which was unknown to Mr. <hi>Living<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton.</hi> Mr. <hi>Livingſton</hi> was a wiſer man, than to take his meaſures of judging of the Lawfulneſs or Unlawfulneſs of hearing Indulged Miniſters, from the Magiſtrates deſigns and intendments: Though Miniſters and People were clear, that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate had an ill deſign, in permitting or allowing Miniſters to Preach the Goſpel, and People to hear, or in permitting Maſters of Families to pray in their Families, or in permitting Phyſicians to cure Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed People; yet no rational man, who is not blinded with Humour or ſome prejudice, will conclude from the Magiſtrates ill deſign, which is his Act, and no way approved, but diſapproved by theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, Maſters of Families, Phyſitians; that it's unlawful for them to Preach, Pray, or Cure Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed Perſons. Mr. <hi>Livingſton</hi>'s fears that Field-meetings would ceaſe, it ſeems have been better founded than the Hiſtorians confidence, that they would continue. And though it cannot be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that Mr. <hi>Livingſton</hi> was an Enemy to Field-meetings, yet none who knew him, will think that he was ſo fond of the Fields, that he would have preferred the Fields to a Kirk, if the Kirk could have contained all who were to hear him. And ſeeing he ſpeaks nothing of Field-meetings, it ſeems he had not learned that new Doctrine of the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, that fatning Feaſts and the wonderful conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance and Bleſſing of God, was onely to be found
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:40126:250" rendition="simple:additions"/> in Fieldings; and that People from whom God juſtly with-holds the Bleſſing in the Kirk, becauſe of ſin, may find it in the Fields, notwithſtanding of their provocations; for if he had been of that Opinion, he would not have failed to exhort his People to go to the Fields. And although he had heard, that the Lord did countenance the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel in the Fields, he would not have Adviſed his People to run at random, to hear any body who Preached in the Fields. No, no, Mr. <hi>Livingſton</hi> was more Adviſed, and ſicker in his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices than ſo, for wiſe men, like Mr. <hi>Livingſton,</hi> uſe to fore-ſee evils, and prevent them, while the ſimple paſs on, and are puniſhed. For Mr. <hi>Living<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> could not but fear, that if his People did run to hear any who Preached in the Fields, though they knew not who the Preacher was, and whence he came, that they might readily find inſtead of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters a cheating Cobler, or a Tanner; inſtead of a ſolid, judicious Miniſter, ſome ignorant raſh young man, who inſtead of the ſincere Milk of the Word, would give the People the windy froth of his own Conceits; and inſtead of the wholſome words of Chriſt, would give them his own ill Humours and Reproaches of honeſt Miniſters, and his own dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings about Queſtions and doubtful Diſputations, which would divert the People from the main thing, and fill their Heads with confounding notions, and their Mouths with vain janglings, and ſo alienate their minds and hearts from theſe things which make for Peace and Edification. Or that they might, perhaps, find inſtead of a Proteſtant Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Miniſter, a Popiſh Prieſt or Frier; and ſo
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:40126:251"/> inſtead of Food find Poyſon, and inſtead of a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, find a Curſe. Mr. <hi>Livingſton</hi> knew the tricks of Jeſuits better than the Hiſtorian, and therefore would have rather Adviſed them ſtill to hear Mr. <hi>John Scot,</hi> who he knew was a Godly Orthodox Miniſter, than have expoſed his People to run ſuch risks; he knew the ſaying, <hi>Qui amat pericula, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribit in illis,</hi> He who loveth hazards, ſhall periſh in them.</p>
               <p>To the third Objection, <hi>That the People heard the Indulged Miniſters, and were Edified by their Miniſtry, till ſome inconſiderate Perſons took it in their Head, to cry out againſt the unlawfulneſs of hearing the Indulged, as if that had been the onely thing neceſſary, for which many even of the Non-indulged are offended with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Hiſtorian Anſwers, <hi>That the Curats might alledge that as well as the Indulged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He is a little out of that ſtory, as well as in many other: Any who knows the truth, knows how great a diſparity there was in the caſes; ſo that his, <hi>as well,</hi> had been as well, and better out than in, for it makes his Allegeance falſe. He ſays, <hi>he is not fit to judge if theſe Perſons be inconſiderate, but he wiſhes that they who call them ſo, would remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that,</hi> Judge not, leſt ye be judged, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He was very unfit by Reaſon of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and miſ-information of many other things, which yet he hath very peremptorily judged. I wiſh he had ſooner conſidered his unfitneſs to judge of others, and had, ere he began to write this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, remembred that, <hi>Judge not, leſt ye be judged;</hi> it might have prevented his writing this Book,
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:40126:251"/> which is mainly founded upon raſh and falſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and reproaches. The inconſiderateneſs of theſe Perſons he ſpeaks of, was ſo evident, and ſo ſenſibly felt in the effects of it, that they who had any conſideration or common ſenſe, could not but ſee it: And the ſecond thoughts, and third thoughts of theſe who were diſpleaſed with their way, makes no change upon theſe Brethren, but confirms them the more. He found not himſelf fit to judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were inconſiderate or not, yet he finds himſelf fit to judge them worthy of praiſe: But if he was not in a capacity to judge them conſiderate, he could be in no good capacity to judge them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of praiſe: For if they were inconſiderate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, they were not to be praiſed; and till he had evidence that they were conſiderate, he might have ſpared his praiſes, and his Bleſſing of God in their behalf, till he had been better informed.</p>
               <p>As for his hopes that the fruits of their labour proclaim their inſiſting upon the one thing neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. I ſee not what ground he had for this hope, for the ordinary fruits of their labour, was the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the fire of Contention, Strife, Debate, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, Reproaches of theſe who followed not with them: But for the fruits of the Spirit, Love, Joy, Peace, Long-ſuffering, Gentleneſs, Goodneſs, Faith, Meekneſs, Temperance, I wiſh we could ſee them in theſe, who with him did ſo much cry up theſe Preachers. He tells us, that at the beginning of the Indulgence, People called them the Councils Curats; and he will not enquire how it came, that that ſpark did not break forth into a general flame; and inſinuates his deſire, that this flame had ſpread
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:40126:252"/> ſooner, and that the firſt ten had been diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced; but he acquieſces in Providence.</p>
               <p>But if he had known what I learned from a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who hath good Intelligence, that it was the late Arch-Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> who was the firſt Inventer of the name of Council-Curats, and did ſo convey the caſting of this ſpark, that he might not be ſeen to be the kindler and caſter of it, and how pleaſant it was to theſe of the Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick party, to ſee the flame kindled by this little ſpark, running, as the Hiſtorian ſpeaks, like Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn among the People. If the Hiſtorian, I ſay, and theſe of his way had known this, it may be they would have taken leſs pleaſure in this Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn, which was ſo pleaſant to theſe to whom the Hiſtorian, I ſuppoſe, did not deſire to make ſport.</p>
               <p>Then he alledges, that ſome ſuppreſſed their judgment about the Indulgence, out of a prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous affection to the Brethren Indulged, whom they much honoured and eſteemed, and that deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly, for their eminent endowments, and ſometimes uſefulneſs in the Church, or out of a tender care of keeping up Union, and guarding againſt all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions apparently tending to troubleſome diſtractions and diviſions: And it's not unlike, ſays he, that many were really in the dark, as to the thing, but however light is light, whoever they be that bring it, how inconſiderable ſoever the Inſtruments be, who are employed, and whether they come ſooner or later; the light when it's come, ſhould be made welcome, becauſe of him who ſent it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe Brethren not onely were, but are yet uſeful, notwithſtanding of all his endeavours to
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:40126:252"/> render them uſeleſs: And affection to them is not prepoſterous, but a commended Duty; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Infirmities they be compaſſed about with, yet they ſhould be eſteemed very highly in love for their works ſake. I think, when he was ſpeaking of the tender care to keep up Union, and to prevent Diviſion, his heart ſhould have ſmitten him, who hath been ſo untender and ſo careleſs in this matter. It's true, light is light; but,</p>
               <p n="1">1. There may be an unſeaſonable bringing forth of light, as if a man would bring a light to a large dark Room, where a man fleeing for his Life, had hid himſelf, to let the purſuer ſee to find and murder the lurking man: Or if one told what way an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent man had fled, to his Enemy, who were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing for his Life; though Light be Light, and Truth Truth, yet that Light was unſeaſonably brought in to the dark Room, and that Truth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably brought forth. But ye will ſay, that doth not hold as to truths revealed in the Scripture. I ſhall Anſwer in the words of Mr. <hi>Durham,</hi> whoſe memory is precious in the Churches, in his <hi>Treatiſe concerning Scandal,</hi> which was his Teſtament to the Church of <hi>Scotland, Part</hi> 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>Pag.</hi> 358. <q>A ſecond way of compoſure, is, when ſuch agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in judgment cannot be obtained, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour a harmony, and keep Unity, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that difference, by a mutual forbearance in things controverted, which we will find to be of two ſorts.</q>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>The firſt is to ſay ſo, total; that is, when nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide doth ſo much as Doctrinally in writ, word, or ſentences of Judicatories, preſs any thing that
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:40126:253"/> may confirm or propagate their own Opinion, or condemn the contrary, but do altogether abſtract from the ſame, out of reſpect to the Churches Peace, and for the preventing of Scandal; and do in things, wherein they agree, according to the Apoſtles direction, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Walk by the ſame Rule, and mind the ſame things mutually, as if there were no ſuch differences, and waiting in theſe, till the Lord ſhall reveal the ſame unto them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This way is ſafe, and where the Doctrine upon which the difference is, is ſuch, as the forbearing the deciſion thereof, doth neither marr any Duty that the Church in general is called to, nor endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Salvation of Souls through the want of clearneſs therein; nor in a word infer ſuch incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, to the hurt of the Church, as ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable awakening, and keeping up of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and diviſions may have with it: Becauſe the ſcope of bringing forth every truth, or confirming the ſame by any Authoritative Sanction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the Edification of the Church, and therefore when the bringing forth thereof doth deſtroy more than Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, it is to be forborn: Neither can it be ground enough to plead for ſuch deciſions in Preaching, that the thing they Preach for is Truth, and the thing they condemn is Error.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe, 1. It is not the Lawfulneſs of the thing ſimply that is in Queſtion, but the neceſſity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency thereof in ſuch a caſe; now many things are lawful, that are not expedient, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.23.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In theſe differences that were in the Primitive times concerning Meats, Days, Genealogies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="513" facs="tcp:40126:253"/> there was a truth or an error upon one of the ſides, as there is a right and a wrong in every contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of ſuch a kind, yet the Apoſtle thinketh fitter for the Churches Peace, that ſuch be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether refrained, rather than any way, at leaſt in publick, inſiſted upon or decided.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe no Miniſter can bring forth every Truth at all times, he muſt then make choice; and I ſuppoſe ſome Miniſters may die, and all do ſo, who have not Preached every truth, even which they knew, unto the People. Beſide, there are (no queſtion) many truths hid to the moſt Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, neither can this be thought inconſiſtent with a Miniſters fidelity, who is to reveal the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God, becauſe that Counſel is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of things neceſſary to mens Salvation, and is not to be extended to all things whatſoever; for we find the great Apoſtle expounding this in that ſame Sermon, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.20. <hi>I have kept back no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was profitable unto you;</hi> which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denceth that the whole Counſel of God, or the things which he ſhewed unto them, is the whole and all that was profitable for them; and that for no by-reſpect or fear whatſoever, he ſhunned to reveal that unto them.</p>
                  <p>Alſo it's clear, that there are many truths which are not decided by any Judicial Act, and among other things, ſparingneſs to decide truths, which are not fundamental judicially, hath been ever thought no little mean of the Churches Peace, as the contrary hath been of Diviſion.</p>
                  <p>The third way (which is the ſecond ſort of the former) of compoſure, is mixed, when there is
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:40126:254"/> ſome medling with ſuch queſtions, yet with ſuch forbearance, that though there be a ſeen difference, yet there is no Schiſm or Diviſion, but that is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly and tenderly prevented; as upon the one ſide, ſome may expreſs their mind in Preaching and Writing on a particular Queſtion, one way, others may do it differently; yet both with that reſpect and meekneſs to thoſe they differ from, that it doth beget no rent, nor give juſt ground of offence, nor marr Union, in any other thing; or it may poſſibly come to be decided in a Synod, yet with ſuch forbearance upon both ſides, that it may prove no prejudice to Union. Thoſe who have Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for them, not preſſing it, to the prejudice of the Opinion, Names, Conſciences of the other, or to their detriment in any reſpect; but allowing to them a liberty to ſpeak their minds, and walk according to their own light in ſuch particulars; and on the contrary, the other reſting ſatisfied in the Unity of the Church, without condemning them, or preſſing them to condemn themſelves, becauſe ſo indeed their Liberty is no leſs than others, who have the deciſion of a Synod for them.</p>
               </q>
               <p>And he adds an inſtance in the Church of <hi>Africa,</hi> where that Queſtion was firſt debated, <q>If Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks after their Converſion, ſhould be again Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized? And a Synod of 300 Biſhops concluded, that they ſhould be re-baptized; yet that Synod carried ſo, that they did not onely not cenſure any that diſſented, nor preſſed them to conform in practiſe to their judgment, but alſo did entertain moſt intimate reſpect to them, and formality with them. And upon the other ſide, we do not find
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:40126:254"/> any in that Church making a Schiſm, upon the account of that Judicial erroneous deciſion, though at leaſt by three ſeveral Synods it was ratified; but contenting themſelves to have their Conſciences free, by retaining their own judgment, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their own practice, till time gave more light, and more occaſion to clear that truth.</q>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>And we will never find in the Writings of any time, more affection among Brethren, and more reſpect to Peace, than was in that Church at that time, amongſt thoſe that differed: And there is not any practice more commended in all the Church-Hiſtory and Writings of the Fathers, than this practice; and partly may be gathered from what was formerly touched out of <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> And if we will conſider the caſe rationally, we will find that it is not impoſſible to have Union in a Church, where there is ſuch a difference, and Authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive deciſion, even ſuppoſing that ſide on which the Error lies, to be approved. For, firſt, there is no neceſſity for ſuch as have Authority for them, to preſs others in their judgment and practice in ſuch things; neither can it be thought that ſuch a deciſion can of it ſelf ſatisfie all ſcruples; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet, that men doubtingly may follow.</p>
                  <p>Nor laſtly, that ſuch Controverſies can bear the weight of troubling the Church, by cenſuring ſuch, as otherways may be faithful; ſeeing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even unfaithful men have been ſpared with reſpect to the Churches good, as hath been ſaid.</p>
                  <p>And Secondly, upon the other ſide, ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Church doth not involve all that keep Communion therein in the guilt thereof, if
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:40126:255"/> perſonally they be free, as in the inſtance of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church is clear; where, no queſtion, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny corrupt Acts have been eſtabliſhed, yet did it neither make Communion in Worſhip or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be unlawful, where the matter and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of carriage was Lawful. Beſide, this would infer, that no Judicatory could keep Union, where there were contrary votes or a Sentence paſſed without unanimity, becauſe that is certainly wrong to them who think otherwiſe, and if ſo, there could be no Judicatory expected, either in Church or State; for it cannot be expected that they ſhall be ſtill unanimous, or that the greater part ſhall cede to the leſſer, and reſcind their own Act. And ſuppoſe there ſhould be ſuch a Diviſion upon one difference, can it be expected, that thoſe who unite upon the divided ſides reſpectively, ſhall again have no more difference among themſelves, and if they have, ſhall there not be a new Diviſion, and where ſhall this end? And ſeeing men muſt reſolve to keep Unity, where there are faults of ſuch a nature, or to have none at all, it is as good to keep it at firſt, as to be neceſſitated to it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>The Orthodox urge this Argument againſt the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> who would not keep Union with them, becauſe of pretended corruptions in the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Judicatories and Ordinations; yet were conſtrained to bear with ſuch amongſt themſelves, and particularly, to receive and unite with the <hi>Maximinianiſts;</hi> whoſe Communion they had once rejected, though a branch of their own Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe they ſaw no end of Diviſions, if they
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:40126:255"/> did not reſolve to diſpenſe with ſuch things amongſt themſelves: And <hi>Auguſtine</hi> often aſſerted that they were never able to Anſwer this Argument, when it was propounded to them; to wit, why they did not give them that ſame Latitude in keeping com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them, which they had given to the <hi>Maximinianiſts,</hi> who were guilty of ſuch things as they imputed to them? We conceive then, that even in ſuch a caſe, there may be Union, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting the main work of the Goſpel, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of ſuch a Circumſtantial difference, if men otherwiſe ſet themſelves to it, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral grounds formerly laid down do confirm this.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Thus far I have tranſcribed the words of the Godly, Learned, Peaceable Mr. <hi>Durham.</hi> I would deſire the Reader to read alſo his 12th. Chapter, and his whole Book, which is a precious Treaſure, which if the Hiſtorian had pondered and practiſed, he, and they who follow him, might through the Lords Bleſſing been kept out of theſe diviſive and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive ways.</p>
               <p>If the Hiſtorian would have followed Mr. <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Advice, firſt, he might have forborn to vent, and to preſs others to vent this which he calls Light, thought it had been Light indeed: For it is no Fundamental truth, that he and they call Light: He cannot charge the Indulged Miniſters, that they maintain Doctrinally any <hi>Eraſtian</hi> Error: All that he alledges upon them, when he explains himſelf, is, that they have by their practice Interpretatively homologate the Supremacy.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing theſe Miniſters taught no erroneous Doctrine concerning the Magiſtrates Power about
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:40126:256"/> Church-matters; but maintain the Principles of all Orthodox <hi>Anti-eraſtian</hi> Divines: And ſeeing they are known to be conſcientious men, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare upon all occaſions, that their practice in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of the Indulgence, is not contrary to, but conſiſtent with and according to the Principles of theſe <hi>Anti-eraſtian</hi> Divines. The moſt that the Author could make out of this, was, that they were miſtaken in the application of theſe Principles to that particular Fact of acceptance of the Peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry from the Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>Now what neceſſity was there in venting this Light? This Interpretative homologation of the Supremacy, which yet is but confounding darkneſs to the poor People, who know not what he means by theſe words by which he explains, how theſe Miniſters are guilty, they cannot Interpret his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretative homologation: His light is to them darkneſs. He clears theſe Indulged Miniſters of having any <hi>Eraſtian</hi> Error in their Head; he grants, they had no ill intention in their mind and heart when they accepted the Indulgence: He grants there was no ill intention in the worker, but in the work done by them; and that what they did, did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally and explicitly import any approbation of any ſinful Supremacy, but onely implicitely, virtually, and interpretatively. What neceſſity was there of telling the People this implicite Error, in a matter of Fact, ſeeing, when he tells it moſt diſtinctly, it's ſo ſubtil a kind of fault, that the People cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it; it's ſo wompled up in <hi>Latine,</hi> impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, perplexed words, that they cannot get a ſight of it? And though the Hiſtorian did really intend
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:40126:256"/> to diminiſh the ſin of the Indulged Miniſters, when he ſaid they themſelves did not intend any ill in their acceptance, but it was onely the intention of the work: And when he ſaid, that the work did not formally and explicitely tend to ill, but virtually, implicitely, and interpretatively: Yet the People are not capable of underſtanding theſe diminiſhing terms; and ſo thinking it to be ſome ill thing, theſe words that are unintelligible by them, increaſes the apprehenſion of the ilneſs or evil of it; even as when ſimple People knows that the thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended is good, if ye commend it in words that they do not underſtand, it heightens their conceit of the goodneſs of it. What effect could the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian think that this dark light could have upon the minds and affections of the poor People, but to beget an ill Opinion of, and prejudice againſt, and hatred of theſe honeſt men, who, as he grants him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, meant no ill. Now, did this any way tend to the Peoples Edification? Did it not, upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, tend to their hurt? For, whereas before they were Edified by the Miniſtry of theſe Miniſters, they are put in an incapacity of getting that good by their Miniſtry, which they were wont formerly to get; ſo that they are no way Edified, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged, and their Edification hindred.</p>
               <p>But 2. If he would have been Adviſed by Mr. <hi>Durham,</hi> he might well have forborn to have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this light, becauſe the forbearance of venting it could no way have endangered the Salvation of the Souls of the People, nor marred them in any Duty that the Church in general is called to, nor could he in Reaſon think, that the withholding of
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:40126:257"/> this light could have ſo many inconveniencies fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing upon it, as the venting of it would have, by an unſeaſonable awakening and keeping up of Diviſions, and all the miſchiefs which follow upon Diviſions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If he would needs vent this Light of his, and preſs others to do the like, he might have done it in the way which Mr. <hi>Durham</hi> points out, <hi>viz.</hi> with that meekneſs, tenderneſs, and reſpect towards his Brethren who differed from him, that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence might make no Diviſion, nor marr Union. But he is ſo far from this, that he will have this Light, and thoſe who bring it, made welcome, though it be brought for this very end to make Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, and to diſtract and rent the Church.</p>
               <p>But 4. The worſt of all is, this Light of his is not Light, but Darkneſs; a confuſed maſs of falſe Calumnies, publiſhed to ſcatter the poor ſheep, and drive them away from their faithful Paſtours, who fed them with knowledge and underſtanding. If they who will not forbear to vent Truths, which are not neceſſary, when the venting of them is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable; or if they, who will vent ſuch Truths in a factious and diviſive way, be juſtly cenſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, O! how hateful is their temper, or rather di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, who cannot be perſwaded for Peace-ſake, to with-hold their Lies and Calumnies, but will vent them, upon deſign, to rent the Church, in drawing away the People from the Lords Miniſters, and the Lords Ordinances. They who come to publiſh untruths, to make Diſcord and Diviſion, come not by the Commiſſion of the God of Truth and Peace. I ſhall again tranſcribe ſome of Mr.
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:40126:257"/> 
                  <hi>Durham</hi>'s words, in his excellent Expoſition of the <hi>Song of Solomon, Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>pag.</hi> 91. —</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Believers would make uſe of publick Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Chriſts Miniſters, eſpecially in reference to ſnares and errors, and they would take their directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from them, and their Counſel would be laid weight upon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Allowed dependance on a Miniſtry is a great mean to keep Souls from error, whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, when no weight is laid on a Miniſtry, unſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Souls are hurried away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Chriſt hath given no immediate or extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way to be ſought unto, and made uſe of, even by his Bride in her difficulties; but the great mean he will have her to make uſe of, is a ſent Miniſtry, and therefore no other is to be expected. It's no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then, that the Devil (when his deſign is to cry down Truth, and ſpread Error) ſeek to draw the Lords People from the Shepherds Tents; and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that Souls who do caſt off reſpect to their Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers, be hurried away with the temptations of the times, as in experience hath often been found a truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Miniſters ſhould have a ſpecial eye on the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the flock; their care ſhould be, that the Kids may be next them: Our bleſſed Lord doth ſo,</hi> When the Lambs are carried in his own boſom, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.11. <hi>And therefore ſeeing weak Believers have moſt need of Chriſts overſight, if they begin to ſlight the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry and Ordinances, they cannot but be a ready Prey, and the Devil hath gained much of his intent, when he hath once gained that. O! that men would try whoſe voice it is, that ſaith,</hi> Come back from the Shepherds Tents, <hi>when Chriſt ſays,</hi> abide
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:40126:258"/> abide near them; <hi>it's as if a Wolf would deſire the Lambs to come out from under the Shepherds eye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And laſtly, when Chriſt gives this direction to his own Bride, we may ſee he allows none to be above Ordinances in the Militant Church; it will be ſoon enough then, when they are brought to Heaven, and put above the reach of Seducers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe words, that Holy man of God, who was a burning and ſhining light, who had the mind of Chriſt, and the bowels of Chriſt, doth clearly from the words of Chriſt warn us, that the voice which ſaith, <hi>Come back from the Shepherds Tents,</hi> is not the voice of Chriſt; this is not light from the Sun of Righteouſneſs, from the face of Chriſt; but darkneſs from the Prince of darkneſs, who can trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf into an Angel of Light.</p>
               <p>Obj. 4. <hi>All or moſt of the Non-indulged, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and Zealous Miniſters in the Land, are for hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Indulged; and onely a few, and thoſe of the younger ſort, with the ignorant People are againſt it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He Anſwers, That he would hope few ſhould lay weight on this Objection, and thinks it enough to refer any ſuch to conſider <hi>John</hi> 7.47, 48, 49. with Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon</hi>'s Notes, eſpecially 7 and 9, and then tells us, that in all the parts of our Tryal, God hath made uſe of the nothings, to break the ice to others. And in the Introduction to his 28 Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he ſays, <hi>That in all our carriage, that is this day approveable, as to the grounds of our Suffering, the Lord hath (for the moſt part) made the poor flock go before the Shepherds, and lead the way to them, rather than the Guides to break the Ice, and lead the way to the flock, as might have been expected.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="523" facs="tcp:40126:258"/>
               <p>I reply: His hope is as groundleſs and reaſonleſs as his imaginations, but he would hope his affection guides his hope, <hi>Credimus an quia amant ipſi ſibi ſomnia fingunt.</hi> And indeed it ſeems he was dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when he hoped that more weight would or ſhould be laid upon the Opinion and Practice of a few young Preachers, and of the ignorant People, than on the judgment and practice of all, not onely Indulged Miniſters, but of all or moſt of the Non-indulged, Faithful, and Zealous Miniſters. And I know none who will joyn with him in this Dream, except it be ſuch, who love to be ſingular, and hope to be more noticed and talked of, when they take odd and ſingular ways, and who lay down that for a Principle, that the feweſt number, eſpecially if they be in greateſt hazard and danger, muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be right, and all others wrong. And when their party grows numerous, they grow ſuſpicious, that all is not right, and ſo they break again, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Separatiſts did at <hi>Amſterdam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Any may ſee how ſtrongly this Hiſtorian hath been Acted by a ſpirit of Diviſion, ſeeing he with a few young men, take upon them, by themſelves, without the knowledge and concurrence; yea, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the known and declared mind of all or moſt of the Non-indulged, Faithful, Zealous Miniſters, to drive the poor People upon the Rock of Schiſm, contrary to the Word of God, and to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Many of the Non-indulged thought it fit to forbear to move that Queſtion about the acceptance of the Indulgence in their Sermons, to the People; they knew weak People, though they be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, yet, having, as Children, ſtrong Paſſions, and
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:40126:259"/> little knowledge, and leſs prudence, to direct their affections, can hardly differ and not divide. Some others, who did touch upon that Queſtion, yet were againſt Separation; but now perceiving that the People have gone further than they intended, are, I ſuppoſe, grieved that they ſhould have ſtarted that Queſtion at all among them; and if it were to do again, would be better adviſed, and are very deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to have the diviſive Diſtempers of the People cured, and the Preachers of Schiſm diſcountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. And yet this Hiſtorian, with two or three of the younger ſort, would contrary to the mind and heart, to the tears and prayers of all his Brethren, increaſe the Diſeaſe, which they were ſtudying to cure, and encourage theſe raſh and inconſiderate Youths to caſt more fire-brands, and add Oyl to the flame.</p>
               <p>I have conſidered the 47, 48, 49 Verſes of the 7th. Chap. of <hi>John,</hi> with Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s. Notes, and the more I conſider it, I think it the more impertinently alledged: For theſe <hi>Phariſees</hi> and Rulers were Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſt; they believed not themſelves, and they endeavoured to hinder others to believe on Chriſt, and are enraged that the People did believe on him. Now, the Miniſters of whom he is ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are not Enemies of Chriſt, but his Servants, and faithful Servants, and zealous for his Glory, and are ſo far from hindering People from believing in Chriſt, or from looking on them, as ignorant and curſed, upon that account, that they ſtudy to bring People to believe in Chriſt, and are grieved that this Author and his Aſſociates withdraws them from Chriſt, by withdrawing them from his Ordinances, where he comes and bleſſes his People, and is in the
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:40126:259"/> midſt of them, and withdraws them from hearing theſe, whom Chriſt ſends to Preach to them, and ſo hinders them from believing, for Faith comes by hearing, and it increaſes by hearing. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> takes notice, that theſe <hi>Phariſees</hi> were puffed up; and I leave it to the conſideration of the Reader, if the way of theſe Faithful and Zealous Miniſters ſeems not to be farther from this, than the way that this Hiſtorian hath taken in this Hiſtory. He ſhews it's an old Engine to keep men from Chriſt, by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of able and eminent Church-men: But the ſtreſs of the Argument, which he propoſes to anſwer, did not lie moſt upon that, that they were Church-men in eminent place, of great parts; but on that, that they were Faithful and Zealous Miniſters: and that they were not ſeeking themſelves, or their own things, but the things of Chriſt, and the Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Body of Chriſt, appears in this, that they are not like the Hiſtorians Youths, who cry down all but themſelves, and draws away the People from all others, to hear themſelves, and tells the People, there is a curſed thing in other Meetings, and warns them to beware of it: But their Faithful Miniſters does not ſeek to engroſs all the Peoples affection to themſelves, but they are for their hearing of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; they behave, as the Lords Miniſters were wont to do in the Primitive times, and as we find the Apoſtles doing in their Epiſtles, they commend and recommend their fellow-labourers to the Churches, and ſtrengthens their hands.</p>
               <p>Again, theſe <hi>Phariſees</hi> took it as an evidence of the Ignorance and Miſery of the People, that they believed on Chriſt. Theſe who ſpeak of the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:40126:260"/> of the People, who withdraw from hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Indulged Miniſters, are far from thinking them Ignorant and Curſed upon that account: But they know, that many of them are very ignorant of Chriſt, and of the way of Salvation; and it's ſad to them that are drawn away from the means of Knowledge, Preaching, and Catechiſing, from learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grounds of Religion, and their Heads filled with vain janglings: And they learn not to know their own ſins, in order to their Humiliation and Self-denial, but learns to know the ſins of others more than their own, and that readily puffs them up.</p>
               <p>What he adds, about the Peoples guiding and breaking the Ice, it blows up the People with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that God hath made them Guides and Leaders, to go before the Miniſters, and made the Sheep to lead the Shepherds. There was enough of wind in this Bladder before; the Hiſtorian might have without any hazard, ſpared his breath here, and not blown up the People with the ill wind of an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural conceit. When the Lord guides his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in his way, he guides them according to his Word, in the uſe of the means that he himſelf hath appointed; he leads his People, like a Flock, by the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> and for my part, when I obſerve, that theſe whom the Lord hath not made Guides, and Leaders, and Shepherds wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſing to be guided and led by theſe whom God hath made Guides and Shepherds, and confidently taking upon them to lead their Leaders. I am very ſuſpicious, that all is not right, and that both the Leaders, and they who are led by them, are wrong. But this is an old trick uſed by theſe who ſtir up
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:40126:260"/> People to Schiſm or Sedition, to give the People fair words, and make much of them. <hi>Corah, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> do highly complement the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; <hi>All the Congregation,</hi> ſay they, <hi>is holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them.</hi> Such fair words will eaſily beguile unſtable Souls. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a judicious and ſober Countrey-man ſaid of one of theſe Preachers, who made it a great part of his work to draw away the People from hearing Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſters, <hi>That he thought he clapped the Bairns heads too much.</hi> The Hiſtorian was miſtaken, if he thought, that withdrawing from the Indulged Miniſters had it's riſe from the People; for it was ſome Preachers, who by private conferences, and publick Preaching drew them away. He alledges, that the matter about hearing the Curats, is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient inſtance of the Peoples good guiding: Yet, I perceive, by what he ſays, that he would not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Peoples guiding, even in this matter, for he does not think the Baptiſms adminiſtrated by them, to be no Baptiſms: But ſome of the People have thought their Baptiſm to be the mark of the Beaſt, and that's much worſe than nothing. He does not think the hearing of Curats ſimply unlawful, and thinks, if there were no other to hear, they ſhould be heard. But ſome of the leading People have thought the hearing of them ſimply unlawful. I heard of ſome, who ſaid, that the hearing of them was as unlawful as Fornication, Adultery, as the Worſhipping of the Calves of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel:</hi> And I ſuppoſe, the Hiſtorian will not deny, that Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſimply unlawful. Some have been ſo far from thinking, that hearing them could ever
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:40126:261"/> become Lawful, that they have placed their Religion and Sincerity in this. A Miniſter informed me, that when he was enquiring concerning the eſtate of a dying woman, he got no other account of any Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that it was well, or would be well with her, but this, that ſhe had never heard a Curate; and I ſuppoſe, the Hiſtorian would have looked on this as a Soul-deluding and deſtructive Error, to make that an Evidence of Sincerity, which a Lazy, Profane, Atheiſtical Perſon can ſo eaſily forbear, and that from a Principle of Lazineſs, Profanity, or Atheiſm. From this it appears, that the People are none of the beſt Guides, in the matter of hearing, ſeeing they have been ſo far from breaking the Ice in the right Foord, that they have broken it above Whirlpools, and have plunged themſelves ſo palpably, that the Hiſtorian himſelf could not follow them. And I am ſo far from ſeeing ſufficient Evidences of the Peoples good guiding of their Guides, that I am very hopeful, that all ſober People will, upon ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſideration of the Errors and Confuſions that ſome People, who would needs guide matters, have run unto, will acknowledge, that it is the good and acceptable will of God, that every one ſhould keep within the bounds of their own vocation, and not take upon them that which the Lord hath not called them to, and that the ſheep ſhould not lead the Shepherds, but be led by them. And I ſuppoſe that ſeveral Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters have by ſad experience found, that they have been indeed led upon the Ice, by following the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of ſome head-ſtrong leading People, who were fitter to break themſelves and the hearts of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, than to break the Ice to make ſafe paſſage for their followers.</p>

               <p>The 5th. Object. <hi>Now when we are in hazard to be over-run with Popery, is it ſeaſonable, that ſuch Queſtions ſhould be ſtarted to break the remnant in pieces, and thereby to make all a Prey to the man of ſin? Were it not better that we were all united as one, to withſtand the Inundation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He Anſwereth, <hi>That he fears, that the Lord by Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Blood will avenge the quarrel of his Covenant, and the contempt of the Goſpel.</hi> I Reply, He ſhould have remembred, that we did covenant to extirpate Schiſm, which he endeavours to plant and water in this Hiſtory. And hath he not expoſed the Goſpel to contempt, in tempting the People to caſt off all the Indulged Miniſters, as no Miniſters of Chriſt, and all almoſt, who are not Indulged, as acted by the ſpirit of Supremacy, the ſpirit of Anti-chriſt? He could not have taken a more compendious way to render the Preaching of the Goſpel contemptible, than to render the Miniſters of the Goſpel contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible. Then he Adviſes, <hi>That we ſhould— acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our ſelves the baſeſt of ſinners.</hi> This Advice is good, but his Schiſmatick directions are contrary to it: A Schiſmatick Spirit is a proud and ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited Spirit. They who ſee themſelves the baſeſt of ſinners, would, if they could, rather ſeparate from themſelves, than others; they will, in lowlineſs of mind, eſteem others better than themſelves; they will acknowledge themſelves leſs than the leaſt of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, unworthy of any remnant of the Lords Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, unworthy to whom the Lord ſhould ſend any of his Meſſengers; ſuch will be far from caſting at any of the Lords Servants or Ordinances.</p>
               <p>Then, he ſays, <hi>Union, ſo long as the accurſed thing
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:40126:262"/> is amongſt us, is a Conſpiracy.</hi> I ſuppoſe, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence is the accurſed thing which he means; but the Magiſtrates permitting and allowing the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able exerciſe of the Miniſtry is a good thing: This is a curſe of his own making, a cauſeleſs curſe; this is one of the tricks of the Devil, to divert People from taking notice of the ſins they are really guilty of, by bogling them with imaginary ſins, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that there is ſin wrapped up in hearing the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel Preach the Goſpel; and ſo he turns Duty to ſin, and by making them take up the peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry, under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Lawful Authority, as if it were a curſe or curſed thing; and ſo flegging poor People, that they flee from, and forſake their own mercies; and it's a dreadful deluſion to miſtake bleſſings, as if they were curſes. He adds, <hi>If we be not tender of Chriſts headſhip, and of what depends thereupon, and of the leaſt pin of his Tabernacle pitched among us</hi> — I Anſwer; If he had been more tender of Chriſt, as head of his Church, he would have been more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Union of the Members of his Body, and would have been afraid to have rent the members of that Body aſunder. His diviſive Doctrine looſes all the pins of the Tabernacle, he hath caſt fire into the Lords Tabernacle, which, if the Lord prevent not, may burn up the Synagogues of God in the Land. His Doctrine tends to diſſolve all Meetings for the publick Worſhip of God, except theſe, who meet at the Separate Meetings, moulded after his conceit.</p>
               <p>He Propheſieth, <hi>That they who follow his way, ſhall find a ſhelter and a Chamber of Protection.</hi> But,
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:40126:262"/> he hath been ſo far miſtaken in taking up things paſt and preſent, they are not wiſe who will believe him, when he Propheſies of things to come; a falſe Hiſtorian is not an Infallible Prophet: He is ſo far wrong in his Precepts for Direction, that I have no Faith to believe his promiſes of Protection. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends Union upon the old grounds of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and ſworn Principles and Maximes: But they who know theſe old grounds, ſee his grounds to be the grounds of the <hi>Engliſh Browniſts,</hi> which were ſolidly refuted by the old Non-Conformiſts. Next,</p>
               <p>He threatneth, <hi>That if there be not an Union in the way that he preſcribes; that is, if there be not a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from theſe Congregations, where Indulged Miniſters are, and alſo from theſe Meetings where Non-indulged Miniſters, who are for hearing Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miniſters Preach</hi> (for he Reproaches theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters alſo, as Acted by the Spirit of Supremacy, the Spirit of Anti-chriſt) <hi>that then this Diviſion from his Separated party will be the certain fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a dark and diſmal Diſpenſation.</hi> And then he Adviſes every man that would have Peace in the day of Gods contending againſt theſe back-ſliders and revolters, <hi>to mourn for this Abomination of the Indulgence, among other Abominations, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the Lord, and to our Principles, which the Lord hath owned and countenanced, though he ſhould be in a manner left alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Diviſion and Schiſmatick renting of the Lords People, this driving of them away from the Lords Ordinances, is more than a fore-runner of a dark and diſmal Diſpenſation; it's an Evidence of the continuance of the Lords Anger,
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:40126:263"/> and that <hi>his hand is ſtretched out ſtill.</hi> Schiſm is a grievous ſin, a dreadful plague, which uſes to end in ruine and deſolation; and they who drive on this vile and deſtructive Schiſm, and ſcare the Lords People from joyning together in the Worſhip of God, they are back-ſliders and revolters from the Principles and Covenant of true Presbyterians: They adhere not to the Lord, who hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his People not to forſake the Aſſembling of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together, and hath promiſed to be with them, when met in his Name, and to come and bleſs them, where he Records his Name, and to be with his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, Preaching and Baptizing in his Name, to the end of the World. They who forſake the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, in which the Lord hath tryſted a meeting betwixt himſelf and his People, they who will not come where the Lord comes, they who will be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, where the Lord promiſes to be preſent, and where he commands his People to preſent themſelves before him, they do not adhere unto the Lord, but depart from the preſence of the Lord; and they who run away from the Society of the People of God, they are not left alone, but have left their Company, they have left the Shepherds Tents, and wander alone, as a Lamb in a large place, as a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wildered Lamb, which being alone, is a prey to every Wild Beaſt; and woe to him, who is, and will be thus alone. It is above ſufficiently cleared, that the Magiſtrate, as Magiſtrate, is the Miniſter of God for good: As the Nurſing-father of the Church, not only may, but ſhould take off Civil reſtraints that hinder the peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry of the Servants of Chriſt, and ſhould grant
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:40126:263"/> to Miniſters the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry, and take care that the Lords People in his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, be fed with the ſincere Milk of the Word of God; and that it is the Duty of Miniſters to accept thankfully of the peaceable publick exerciſe of their Miniſtry, when the Magiſtrate grants it; and to make the Magiſtrates Duty in allowing the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel in his Dominions, or the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Duty in making uſe of the Magiſtrates grant of the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry, in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel, or to make the Peoples Duty, in hearing the Goſpel Preached by theſe Miniſters, an Abomination, to be mourned for, is to teach Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to pervert their own Mercies, and to turn them, to Curſes, and to divert them from laying to heart real Abominations, which are real cauſes of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to mourn for that, for which they ſhould give thanks. Such falſe viſions are matter of mourning, and were among <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s Lamentations, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Thy Prophets have ſeen vain and fooliſh things for thee, and they have not diſcovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy Captivity; but have ſeen for thee falſe burdens, and cauſes of Baniſhment.</hi> The good old Principles of Presbyterians did not lead them to deſpiſe Dignities, they feared God and honoured Rulers, and did humbly Supplicate for Liberty for Preaching the Goſpel, and did thankfully accept of any ſuch Liberty, when it was granted by the Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>He adds, <hi>pag.</hi> 162. <hi>Will not, I pray, many of theſe who have complyed with Prelacy, and with the courſes that have been carried on, profeſs an abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency at Popery? And is this ground ſufficient for us
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:40126:264"/> to think of uniting with them, notwithſtanding of all they have done, that we may be the more forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to withſtand that torrent?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> What is the importance of his praying in this place: Or if it be an idle inſignificant word, is not worth the enquiry: But it may be he was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that his Arguments had no force to convince his Readers judgment and Conſcience, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he makes uſe of earneſt Supplication to work upon his Readers Affections; that what he could not extort by the ſtrength of Reaſon, he might obtain it by importunate praying and begging of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; and ſo gain the thing in queſtion, by reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting as Beggers, who have no price to purchaſe what they would be at, do importunately ſeek what they cannot buy; and thus he would have the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>Si non juſto pretio, ſaltem prece &amp; precariò.</hi> When his praying is done, let us ſee what he ſays to the Cauſe: His Reaſoning is to this purpoſe. <hi>If the profeſſed abhorrence of Popery be no ſufficient ground for us to think of uniting with theſe who have complyed with Prelacy, that we may be the more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to withſtand the torrent of Popery, then the Presbyterians may break off that Fellowſhip in the Worſhip of God, which they had in theſe Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where Indulged Miniſters Preach, and may diſown theſe Miniſters, whom they once owned as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and their Miniſters, and withdraw from hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, whom they invited to Preach to them, and whom they did hear and countenance in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Miniſtry. But ſo it is, that the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency of Popery, profeſſed by theſe who have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with Prelacy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is no ſufficient ground of
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:40126:264"/> Uniting Presbyterians with theſe complyers, and therefore Presbyterians ſhould break off,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The connexion is very ill knit, it's looſe work; for although the profeſſed abhorrency of Popery, and the deſign of withſtanding Popery, were not ſufficient to make up Union betwixt the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians and the Prelatick party, it would not follow, that Presbyterians who are United in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Government, ſhould break off their Communion in the Worſhip of God, and, as it is in the Objection, by breaking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in pieces, expoſe themſelves as a Prey to the Man of Sin; there is no ſhadow of Reaſon for this Conſequence: For this ground of Uniting Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians and complyers with Prelacy, may be inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and yet there may be a vile Schiſm in Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians breaking themſelves in pieces.</p>
               <p>Although the Invaſion of a common Enemy be not thought a ſufficient ground of Uniting two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Parties in a Nation, yet it may be a very ſtrong motive to keep theſe of the ſeveral Parties United in theſe things, in which they are United, and it ſhould keep them from making ſub-diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for the more Diviſions, the Nation is the more weakened, and the more expoſed as a Prey to the Invader.</p>
               <p>It ſeems the Author hath been againſt all ſort of Uniting with theſe who comply with Prelacy. It's true, Presbyterians ſhould not Unite with them, in their complyance with Prelacy, nor joyn with them in any ill courſe: But there are many things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we may Unite with Papiſts themſelves; do not Proteſtants joyn with Papiſts againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> in
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:40126:265"/> believing that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is come? If an <hi>Arrian</hi> were like to put a Popiſh Doctor out, would it not be the Duty of a Proteſtant Miniſter, if he were preſent, to aſſiſt the Popiſh Doctor, in maintaining the Trinity, and the Deity of the Son of God? May not Papiſts and Proteſtants Unite in defending their Native Countrey againſt the <hi>Turks?</hi> May not Chriſtians Unite with Pagans, in doing ſome work of neceſſity? <hi>Paul</hi> wrought with the Pagans, with whom he ſailed, in caſting out the tackling of the Ship. May not Chriſtians joyn with Pagans, in ſaving and helping Ship-broken men to ſhore? May not, ſhould not Proteſtants, whether they be Non-conformiſts, or Conformiſts, joyn together in the abhorrency of Popery, and in withſtanding the current of it? Would the Hiſtorian have Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants more demented than the very <hi>Jews,</hi> when they were Judicially plagued with inteſtine Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Seditions, while the <hi>Romans</hi> beſieged <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;</hi> yet they had ſo much ſenſe remaining, that they left off their inward fightings when the <hi>Romans</hi> made any Aſſault, and joyned together in defending the Walls of the City. We muſt abhor what is evil in men, and muſt have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs; but we ſhould not abhor that which is good, even in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts or Pagans. Mr. <hi>Rutherfurd,</hi> in his <hi>Peaceable Plea for</hi> Pauls <hi>Presbytery in</hi> Scotland, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>pag.</hi> 124. <hi>Conſideration</hi> 8.

               </p>
               <p>The Hiſtorian himſelf in ſome caſes grants, that we ſhould joyn in the Worſhip of God with theſe who comply with Prelacy, notwithſtanding of all they have done, as we ſaw from his conceſſions in the ſtating of the Queſtion; and yet here he ſpeaks, as if all Uniting with them were ſinful. If the hearing of theſe who have complyed with Prelacy, be at any time a Duty, then the hearing of them is no complyance with Prelacy; and if the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them who have really complyed with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, be not a complyance with Prelacy; then ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Indulged Miniſters had really complyed with an <hi>Eraſtian</hi> Power in the Magiſtrate, yet the hearing of the Indulged Miniſters would not have been any complyance with <hi>Eraſtianiſm.</hi> How much then is this Hiſtorian in the wrong, to the poor People, who would fright them from hearing the Indulged Miniſters, who have never complyed with any <hi>Eraſtian</hi> Power, or ſinful Supremacy in the Magiſtrate, as if the hearing of the Word of God Preached by them, were ſinful, a homologating of a ſinful Supremacy.</p>
               <p>He adds, <hi>Alas, this our ſtrength will prove our weakneſs; let us remember that of</hi> Eſay 8.11, 12, 13, 14. He means, that Uniting in the Worſhip of God in theſe paroches, where Indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:40126:266"/> are ſettled, is our weakneſs, and ſo that it's Peoples ſtrength to withdraw from the Worſhip of God in theſe Paroches. This muſt be his meaning, or he ſays nothing to the purpoſe in hand. This is one of the Hiſtorians Paradoxes, that Union in the true Worſhip of God, is the Churches weakneſs; and that the breaking off that Union, is the Churches ſtrength. That is to ſay, a Church divided ſhall ſtand: It ſeems, a Church is not like other Societies, for our Saviour ſays, <hi>A Houſe and Kingdom divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded cannot ſtand.</hi> This is a pitiful Paradox, for it's contrary to Scripture, Reaſon, Common Senſe, Experience; and the Author brings no ſhadow of Reaſon to give it any colour of probability, but as he began his laſt Reaſon with praying, ſo he Uſhers in this pitiful Paradox with lamentation, that ſeeing it had nothing in it, nor upon it, to plead for it's admiſſion, it might be received of meer pity. He ſhould have conſidered, that a Printed Book would readily come to the hands of Rational men, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not Paſſions that are void of Reaſon, and who will not be prayed or lamented out of their wits: Yet this will paſs currant among weak People, who will be more moved with an Oh, or an Alas, than with ten ſolid Reaſons or Scripture-Teſtimonies.</p>
               <p>The Scripture which he exhorts us to remember, makes nothing for withdrawing from hearing the Word of God Preached by the Lords Miniſters: When the Lord Inſtructed the Prophet, <hi>That he ſhould not walk in the way of that People, nor ſay a Confederacy to all them, to whom that People ſaid a Confederacy.</hi> He did not diſcharge the Prophet to hear the Word of God, or to joyn with the Lords
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:40126:266"/> People in the Worſhip of God. The way of Gods Ordinances is the way of God, in which the Lords goings are, and in which his People walk with him, and in which he hath commanded them to walk; but the way of that People was their ſinful ways, ways of their own which were not Gods ways; the Confederacy diſcharged was not joyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Lords Ordinances, for the Lord had commanded his People to Aſſemble together for his Solemn Worſhip, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.11, 12, 13. <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.19, 20. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.7, 8.16.17. But the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy diſcharged, is a Confederacy with the King of <hi>Aſſyria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He cites <hi>Amos</hi> 4.12, 13. Where the Lord di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects his People <hi>to prepare to meet their God.</hi> This Scripture is as little to the Hiſtorians purpoſe as the former, for the way to meet with God, is not to withdraw from the Worſhip of God; but upon the contrary, they who would meet with God, muſt come to his Ordinances, for there he meets with them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.22. <hi>Exod.</hi> 29, 42, 43. He hath ſaid, <hi>That they who hear his Servants, hear himſelf, and hath bleſſed theſe who hear him, and watch daily at his gates, and wait at the Poſts of his Doors.</hi> That's the way to find him, to find Life, <hi>&amp;c. Prov.</hi> 8.32, 33. He hath promiſed, that where he Records his Name, he will come to his People and bleſs them. Separation from the Lords Ordinances is no preparation to meet with God, but it is a depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God: And if this Separation from the Lords People, and from his Worſhip, be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the Separating of our ſelves from every ſinful courſe, the Chriſtian complyance which he
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:40126:267"/> ſpeaks of, is an unchriſtian miſ-application of that word in the 4th. of <hi>Amos:</hi> And if he thought that they who have heard the Indulged Miniſters, muſt utterly forſake that way, as a way provoking the Lord to wrath, he was quite out, and utterly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken about this utter forſaking.</p>
               <p>The Scripture with which he cloſeth, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. is not for his ſcattering of the Lords Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but for the gathering of them together to the Solemn Worſhip of God. If the Author had pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered this Scripture, and obſerved the directions of the Spirit of the Lord, which are given in it, he would not have endeavoured to ſcatter the Lords People; and if he had made more Conſcience of ſeeking Righteouſneſs, he would not have done ſo many and great wrongs and injuries to his innocent Brethren, who had done him no wrong, and who were doing right things; and if he had made more Conſcience of ſeeking Meekneſs, he would have been more quiet, and either altogether been ſilent, or ſpoken and written of theſe things with more calmneſs and compoſure of Spirit: If meekneſs (as they ſay) were loſt, it would be a hard work to find it in this Hiſtory, in which there is much of the wrath of man, which perfects not the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God. He concludes well with two Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Lords Prayer, <hi>Thy Kingdom come, thy Will be done.</hi> If he had looked to the Expoſition of the Second Petition of the Lords Prayer in the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Catechiſm, he would have found, that this is a part of the meaning of that Petition, that the Church may be countenanced and maintained by the Civil Magiſtrate; and to confirm this, the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
                  <pb n="541" facs="tcp:40126:267"/> 2.1, 2. is cited, <hi>I exhort therefore that firſt of all Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſions, and Thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings be made for all men, for Kings, and for all that are in Authority: That we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all Godlineſs and Honeſty.</hi> Which ſhews, that the Aſſembly of Divines at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> did not think, that the Kingdom of Chriſt is to be ſet up by ruining earthly Kings and Kingdoms, and that they take not the right way to advance Chriſts Kingdom, who reject the Magiſtrates countenance, and maintenance of the Church: Or who by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing and provoking Magiſtrates to wrath, tempts them to diſcountenance the Church. And ſeeing they look on the Church as Chriſts Kingdom, the Hiſtorian hath not taken the right way to advance this Kingdom, but hath taken the way to ruine it, by dividing it; <hi>For a Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf, cannot ſtand.</hi> And if he had pondered the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the third Petition, it might have been a mean to have prevented his giving ſo much place to his own Humour and Will in this Hiſtory, and helped him to more ſubmiſſion unto the Holy Providence of God, than doth appear in this Hiſtory. I wiſh he had, ere he began to write this Hiſtory, put up that Petition, <hi>And lead us not into temptation:</hi> Or at the cloſe of it, put up that Petition, <hi>And forgive us our ſins.</hi> We have great need, ere we begin De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates and Controverſies, even when they are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, to pray, that we be not led into temptation: And great need to cloſe ſuch Debates, even when the cauſe maintained is right, with praying, Lord, forgive us our ſins. I have examined all that had any appearance of Reaſon in this Hiſtory, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:40126:268" rendition="simple:additions"/> many things which needed no refutation, if it had not been for the ſake of ſimple People, who are often deceived by big words, where there is no ſhew or colour of Reaſon. I have often by Reaſon refuted the unreaſonable clamours, both of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Epiſtle, and of the Hiſtory; whereas I might have oppoſed clamour to clamour, for what is founded upon meer clamour, may be as eaſily cried down as it's cried up. Let none becauſe of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors errors in this Hiſtory, caſt at other uſeful Books which he hath publiſhed; nor reject any thing that is true and right in this Hiſtory. Good men have their failings, and we may not take our meaſures of them from their miſcarriages under a fit of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends had a juſt hatred againſt Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, and they miſtake <hi>Job,</hi> and falls foul upon him, as a Hypocrite, and ſpeaks many things that are not right things, in the heat of Debate. This Author had a juſt indignation againſt <hi>Eraſtianiſm,</hi> and a Spiritual Supremacy in Magiſtrates; and he apprehended that his brethren had interpretatively homologate this <hi>Eraſtian</hi> and Spiritual Supream power in the Magiſtrate, and having miſtaken them, he hath fallen foully upon them, and ſpoken much evil of them without cauſe. Theſe things which in the Epiſtle and Hiſtory are wrong, are things for the moſt part, which ſeveral people had drunk in, and the printing of theſe errours, hath given occaſion to rectifie the miſtakes of erring peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if they will not ſhut their eyes againſt the light. The Lord who is excellent in working, draws good out of evil, and maketh all things work together for good to them who love him, and are the called
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:40126:268"/> according to his purpoſe he can over-rule the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of error, ſo as it ſhall be ſubſervient to clear the truth. In the worſt times the Elect hath obtained and ſhall obtain. The Lord reigneth and ruleth in the midſt of Enemies, he can when men are ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the duſt of <hi>Zion,</hi> be making way for laying a ſolid foundation, in the deep humiliation of his people, for building his houſe: The Church hath been before, as dry and ſcattered bones, as bones ſcattered at the graves mouth; and yet he who raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the dead, hath made theſe bones to come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and live. It's our beſt to leave the anſwering of that Queſtion, <hi>Can theſe Bones live?</hi> To the Lord himſelf, to <hi>Jehovah, who makes things that are not, to be; who doeth great things and unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, marvellous things, and without number.</hi> If we would take ſhame and confuſion of face to our ſelves, and would humble our ſelves in the ſight and ſenſe of our ſins, our darkneſs, and ſtumblings, and juſtlings in the dark; and juſtifie the Lord in his judgments that are come upon us, and yet aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe to him the glory of his Mercy; and out of our depths and darkneſs cry to him, that he would cauſe his face to ſhine and enlighten our darkneſs, and ſend out his Light and Truth, and pour out the Spirit of a ſound mind; and that he would quicken us by the Spirit of Life, that is in Chriſt Jeſus, that we might call on his Name, <hi>and look on him whom we have pierced and mourn;</hi> &amp; that when mens endeavours to gather the ſcattered ſheep, are not effectual, that he the great Shepherd would ſeek out his ſheep, and deliver them out of all places where they have been ſcattered in the cloudy and

And if we would wait on him in the way of his Judgments, and hope in his Word, his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which he uſes to remember for his People, and to repent according to the multitude of his Mercies; and though we have no ground of hope in our ſelves, yet hope againſt hope, on the Lord, <hi>who is the hope of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and the Saviour thereof in the time of trouble, and that becauſe with him there is Mercy and plenteous Redemption.</hi> And ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue humbly praying, hoping, waiting for him.

Let us take ſhame to our ſelves, and give him the glory due to his Name; that his Name may endure for ever, and be continued as long as the Sun, that men may be Bleſſed in him, and all Nations call him Bleſſed. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God, the God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>who onely doeth wondrous things, And Bleſſed be his Glorious Name for ever and ever, and let the whole Earth be filled with his Glory.</hi> Amen, <hi>and</hi> Amen.</p>

                     <hi>SIR, there are many things conſiderable in this Anſwer to the Hiſtory of the Indulgence, which I purpoſe to conſider; but there is one thing which not a little troubles me: That the withdrawing from hearing the Indulged Miniſters is called Schiſm. Now I remember we are by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant bound to extirpate Schiſm, and if I have been practiſing Schiſm, in withdrawing from hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Indulged Miniſters, I have been Acting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Miniſter.</speaker>
                  <p>They who deal truly in the matter of the Covenant, will ſtudy to fulfill their Vows, not onely in ſome things, but in all things.</p>
                  <p>Schiſm is a diſſolution of that Union which ought to be among Chriſtians, and eſpecially it appears in refuſing that Church-fellowſhip or Eccleſiaſtical Communion, which ought to be obſerved, or in an unwillingneſs to communicate, or to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the true Church in Holy Actions.</p>
                  <p>Caſuiſts ſhew, that it is a moſt grievous ſin.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is contrary to Charity towards our Neighbour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is contrary to the Edification of him who Separates, in depriving him of Communion in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual good.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It's contrary to the Honour of Chriſt, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to the Unity of his Myſtical Body.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It makes way for Hereſie, and Separation from Chriſt.</p>
                  <pb n="546" facs="tcp:40126:270"/>
                  <p>If ye would be cleared of the unlawfulneſs of this Schiſm, or Separation, in your withdrawing from the Indulged Miniſters, and theſe Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions where they Preach; or, which is all one, in withdrawing from that Church-communion in the Worſhip of God, which ye had formerly in theſe Congregations, as if it were unlawful to joyn with them in the Worſhip of God: I deſire you would read the Writings of the Old Non-Conformiſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Separatiſts; particularly I recommend to you Mr. <hi>Rutherfurd</hi>'s <hi>Peaceable Plea for</hi> Paul's <hi>Presbytery in</hi> Scotland, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. from <hi>pag.</hi> 120. to <hi>pag.</hi> 149. Where he proves that it's unlawful to Separate from the true Church viſible for the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Teachers, and the wickedneſs of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours and Profeſſours. Where Faith is begotten by the Preaching of Profeſſed Truth, it is not every Error or Corruption in Miniſters or Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, which will warrant Separation, as he ſhews. A Miniſter who Preaches the body of Divinity ſoundly, howbeit he mixes Errors with it, may be heard, and yet we may be no way defiled with his Error, if we reject it. We are, ſaith he, to hear the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> but to beware of their leaven, and finding it to be ſour and unſound Doctrine, we are to reject it. What think ye would he have judged of your Separation? Seeing ye Separate from a Church, where the Miniſter, and People who ſubmits to his Miniſtry, do profeſs and hold the whole Doctrine of Salvation, contained in the Word of God, and particularly in the Confeſſions of Faith, of this National Church, and rejects all Errors contrary thereto; they have all the parts of
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:40126:270"/> Worſhip of Divine Inſtitution, and no falſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They own and ſubmit to the Diſcipline of the Church, which is of Divine Inſtitution, and owns no Offices or Officers in the Church of God, but ſuch as the Lord hath appointed to be in his Houſe.</p>
                  <p>Again, your Separating from a particular Church, where the Worſhip of God is in every thing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſts Inſtitution, is by neceſſary and undeniable conſequence a Separation from all other Churches, where the Worſhip of God is celebrated according to Chriſts Inſtitution, and ſo is a Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the Univerſal Church, and from Chriſt in it.</p>
                  <p>The tendency and efficacy of this ſinful Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may be ſeen in the miſchievous effects of it, in diſſolving the Bond of Love, in taking People off from the Duties of Love and mutual Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and tends to Malice, Hatred, Envy, Whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering, raſh uncharitable judging, Cenſuring, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Back-biting, Slandering, Reproaching, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faming, Vain jangling, Strife, Contention, and the evil works which follow thereupon.</p>
                  <p>This Separation is one of the moſt groundleſs Separations that ever was in the Church, and ſo one of the moſt vile Schiſms that ever hath been heard of. And the more groundleſs any Separation is; as it is the more ſinful, ſo it produces ordinarily the more ſin; for when People have groundleſly Separate, and cannot give an account of the cauſe of their Separation, and yet will not Repent and return, they are under a dreadful temptation to
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:40126:271"/> make up, or take up falſe Reproaches and Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies againſt theſe from whom they Separate, that they may have ſomething to ſay for themſelves; and this increaſes to more and more ungodlineſs, and unrighteouſneſs, to Strife, Envy, Confuſion, and every evil work.</p>

                  <p>Such Deſigns do uſually beguile ſimple People, who think if the intention be good, all is right; but, Sir, you who are a Preacher, know that there are many more things required to make any one Action good, beſide a right intention: <hi>We muſt not do evil that good may come of it;</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of good will not juſtifie the doing of evil. Some have, as they thought, deſigned the ſerving
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:40126:271"/> of God, when they were killing his Servants; but this did not juſtifie their Murther.</p>

                  <p>It would take a long time to relate them, let be to refute them: I have ſeen two Refutations of that Band. I ſhall give you ſome ſhort Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations out of one of theſe Papers.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They have been very injurious to Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, in arrogating to themſelves the Title of the <hi>True Presbyterian Party,</hi> ſeeing their Principles and Practices are contrary to the Principles of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, which are publiſhed in their Confeſſions of Faith and Covenants: And they have in this very Bond, ſo clearly diſtinguiſhed themſelves from, and conſtitute themſelves a Party Separate from the generality of the Presbyterians, that they who would gladly have faſtened and Fathered this Band and Declaration upon Presbyterians, have given over that unreaſonable attempt, for they ſaw that tale would not tell.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The whole contrivance looks like an Act of <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> or of men deſperate, ruſhing upon ruine and Death: They ſay, they are put to it by God, which looks like an <hi>Enthuſiaſtick</hi> impulſe. Some endeavoured to excuſe them from <hi>Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm,</hi> by the words of the firſt Article, where they take the Scriptures to be the object of their Faith, and Rule of their Converſation; but when they
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:40126:272"/> looked more narrowly to the words, and found that they ſay not the Word of God in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but his Scriptures and Word, they found that they had not ſufficiently cleared themſelves of <hi>Enthuſiaſm;</hi> for this ſeems to ſay, that there is a word diſtinct from the Scriptures, which they alſo take for the Object of their Faith, and Rule of their Converſation, ſome <hi>Enthuſiaſtick</hi> expreſſions dropped in Sermons did increaſe the ſuſpicion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When they ſay, their Conſcience and Men put them to it, how ſhall we know that it was not an erring Conſcience; they muſt ſhew us by what Rule their Conſcience was directed. And men are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible both in making and breaking Covenants. <hi>They like men,</hi> ſaith the Lord, by the Prophet <hi>Hoſea, have tranſgreſſed the Covenant.</hi> Theſe men might have conſulted with fleſh and blood, and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that by getting others engaged in the ſame danger with themſelves, they might be ſafer in a throng.

                  <p n="4">4. They engage in the 2d. <hi>Art. That they ſhall to the utmoſt of their Power,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a very neceſſary clauſe in the League and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>viz. We ſhall endeavour in our ſeveral Places and Callings,</hi> Art. 1. <hi>And in our ſeveral Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,</hi> Art. 3. They ſaw that if they had kept within the bounds of their Callings, they could never have had acceſs to make that terrible Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in Kirk and Kingdom which they deſigned:
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:40126:272"/> Their Places and Vocations did not allow or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant them to overturn King and Kingdom, and bring all Miniſters that were not of their way, to ſtand at their Bar. And therefore being reſolved to paſs the bounds of their Vocation, they left out theſe words of the Covenant, which manifeſtly croſſed their Deſigns.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They ſay in that 2d. <hi>Art. We ſhall to our Power, relieve the Church and Subjects of this Kingdom (we being called thereto by his giving of us Power, Power being Gods call to do good) of that oppreſſion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This is, I ſuppoſe, a new Principle in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, that Power or Strength is Gods call. The <hi>Turk</hi> thinks he hath a Call and Right to take all that he hath might to Conquer; but this is a part of <hi>Turciſm,</hi> which Chriſtians deteſt. It's good that Malefactors who deſerve Death, be Executed; but every man who hath ſtrength or pith to kill them, is not called of God to put them to death. It's good that there be Magiſtrates to govern a City, it's good that the Goſpel be Preached; but every man who hath ability to Govern a City, or to Preach, is not called of God to Govern or to Preach. If this Principle were reduced to practice, it would turn the World up-ſide down. It's good that a Maſter, who hath injured his Servant, ſhould be puniſhed: May therefore a Servant, if he be ſtronger than his Maſter, puniſh him? Is he called of God to do it? If ability to do good, were Gods call, the man who deſired Chriſt to ſpeak to his Brother, to divide the Inheritance with him, might have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:40126:273"/> to our Saviours Queſtion, <hi>Man, who made me a Judge or a Divider over you?</hi> That ſeeing Chriſt had ability to judge and divide, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was called of God to judge and divide.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Seeing they had not power or ſtrength to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuate theſe great things, which they undertake in this and the following Articles; and ſeeing there was no probability, that a few private Perſons could ever be in a capacity to do theſe things: And ſo ſeeing, according to their own deſcription of Gods c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="553" facs="tcp:40126:273"/> ſo he hath appointed Order in the State, and the one of theſe ſhould not be overturned to eſtabliſh the other. It's the earneſt deſire of Presbyterians, that the removal of all diſorders in the Church, and the reparation of the Ruines of the Church may be by the hand of their rightful Rulers.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. What confidence can the Subjects have, that they who have ſo eaſily ſhaken themſelves looſe of ſubjection to Lawful Rulers, to whom God hath commanded them to be ſubject for Conſcience-ſake, will be very tender of the Conſciences of others, and will not exerciſe oppreſſion upon the Conſciences of theſe who would be under them? No great tenderneſs can rationally be expected from theſe, who have ſo lightly looſed themſelves from the Obligation of the 3d. Article of the Covenant. Or what confidence can they have, that their Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders will not diſpoſſeſs them of their Civil Rights, if they find any fault in them, ſeeing they engage themſelves to diſpoſſeſs the King and Subordinate Magiſtrates of their places, to which they have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted right? Or that they who make not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to attempt the greateſt deſturbance that can be imagined in the whole Kingdom, will regard the quiet or diſturbance of private Perſons?</p>
                  <p>Again, the Subjects do not deſire to be relieved in the way laid down in this Bond, which is indeed the way of Diſorder, Confuſion, and Deſolation; they think the Remedy would prove worſe than the Diſeaſe. And what Right can be expected from theſe who makes Power and might to be a Call and Warrant for their Actings.</p>

                     <pb n="554" facs="tcp:40126:274"/>7. It may ſeem ſtrange, that they could in the 3d. Article mention the National Covenant and Solemn League and Covenant, without terrour and ſhame. Seeing they have ſo manifeſtly in many things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from theſe Covenants, and gone croſs to them, in this very Bond; for although in words they engage to extirpate Popery, in all the Articles of it, yet they really and effectually plant and eſtabliſh ſeveral Popiſh Articles. It's a Popiſh Article, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Reformed Churches ſhould not be owned as Miniſters, that Communion ſhould not be kept with them, nor with theſe who joyn with them, in the publick Worſhip of God: The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this Bond ſay the ſame of all the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who are not of their own Opinion and way; and, for any thing known, when this Bond came forth, theſe whom they own for Miniſters, were but two or three at moſt, and they renounce Communion in the Worſhip of God, with all who joyn not with them in their wild and furious conceits. And thus they yield this to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, that there are no Miniſters nor Churches in <hi>Scotland</hi> with which Chriſtians ſhould joyn in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian or Church-fellowſhip. It's a Popiſh Article, that the Pope may depoſe Kings and Magiſtrates, and free Subjects of their Allegiance to Kings and Rulers, and that any private Perſon may kill theſe Rulers whom the Pope hath Excommunicated and Depoſed.</p>
                  <p>The Authors of this Bond in their Depoſing the King and Subordinate Rulers, and in declaring them no Rulers, and in engaging to execute Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them. (I ſhall forbear to ſpeak of
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:40126:274"/> their late Excommunication of them, becauſe I have not ſeen it) they have confirmed the Papiſts in theſe Errors, for they will think that the Pope may claim as much Power over Kings to whom he is not Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as their own private Subjects claim.</p>
                  <p>Again, it's one of the Popes pranks to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict Countries, or Cities, that he hath a quarrel at, in diſcharging all publick Worſhip of God in them; theſe Banders have done the ſame upon the matter, in going about to hinder, as far as their Power reaches, all publick Worſhip of God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in theſe parts where their Preachers come.</p>
                  <p>We are by Covenant obliged to extirpate Schiſm; this Bond engages theſe who take it in one of the vileſt Schiſms that hath been heard of in the Church, as appears Article 6.</p>
                  <p>The Covenant is for the extirpation of Prelacy; but theſe Banders, though in words they engage to do ſo, yet they really make theſe Miniſters of theirs, who are far from the number of fourteen, in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Prelates, and will have all the Miniſters of the Church to ſtand in Judgment before theſe Judges, and to be no Miniſters, except theſe Miniſters of theirs will.</p>
                  <p>And thus they really overturn Presbyterial Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which the Covenant obliges to preſerve. The Covenant obliges to preſerve the Priviledges of Parliament, Liberties of the Kingdoms, and the Kings Majeſties Perſon and Authority. This
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:40126:275"/> Bond engageth to deſtroy the King and his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and to alter the very form of Government; ſo that if it ſhould take effect, there would be no King, nor Parliament, nor Kingdom in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>And contrary to the 4th. Article of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, they make Factions among the People, and go about to divide the King from the People, by a moſt deſtructive Diviſion in deſtroying the King.</p>
                  <p>The Covenant keeps every man in his own place and Calling, but all who take this Band, bind themſelves in this 3d. Article, to execute Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judgment impartially according to the Word of God, and degree of wickedneſs upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitters of Blaſphemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that all who take this Band, Miniſters and People, Man and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, engage themſelves to Act the part of Judges, in executing Righteous Judgment. But who made them Judges? They ſhould have ſtaid till they had gotten a call to Judge, and had been in a capacity of Judging, before they had ſworn to execute Righteous Judgment.</p>
                  <p>Again, if all of them had been Judges, execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Righteous Judgment, then all would have been Rulers, and ſo there would have been none of them to be Ruled and Judged; and thus not onely their Miniſters, but alſo all their Men old and young, and their Women, are engaged to paſs the bounds of their Calling, and to perform that which would have been impractical and impoſſible.</p>

The formers of this Bond ſeem to have been unacquainted with the judgment of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians concerning the National Covenant; for in this Band they ſpeak, as if Prelacy were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the National Covenant, but onely by the League and Covenant. They who engroſſed to themſelves the Title of the true Presbyterian Party, ſhould not have been ſo ignorant of the ſentiments of Presbyterians.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. They who take this Band and adhere to it, cannot ſubſcribe the Covenants: And I heard of one of this way, who ſaid, if the ſubſcribing of the Covenant were to do again, his hand ſhould rather be cut off, than ſubſcribe it: This ſhews, that this Band is inconſiſtent with theſe Covenants.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. In the 4th.

                     <pb n="560" facs="tcp:40126:277"/>11. It's very ſtrange, that they ſay, that it cannot be thought that there is hope of the Magiſtrates Repentance. Was it not enough to them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerate the Magiſtrates ſins beyond the bounds of Truth and Soberneſs? But they muſt alſo magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and multiply them above the multitude of the great Mercies of God. Who can limit the Sovereign grace of God, <hi>who hath Mercy on whom he will have Mercy?</hi> The example of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi>'s Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance might have reſtrained them from this bold encroaching upon the Sovereignty of Free Grace.</p>
                  <p n="12">12.

                  <p>Though <hi>Saul</hi> was an ungodly man, and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted <hi>David</hi> without a cauſe, and drove him out of the Land, from the Ordinances, and expoſed him to the hazard of ſerving other gods: Though he unjuſtly and very ſummarily ſlew eighty five Prieſts of the Lord, and contrary to the manner of
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:40126:277"/> the Kingdom, which obliged him to maintain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Righteouſneſs, did put the Foundations of the Earth out of courſe, yet <hi>David</hi> did not think himſelf obliged to diſown <hi>Saul</hi> to be King, nor did he think himſelf obliged to kill <hi>Saul</hi> when he had Power and Opportunity to do it; he will not ſuffer his Men to do it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.6, 7. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.8, 9. He did not think that his killing of <hi>Saul</hi> was the way to free the Land from Guiltineſs; yea, his heart ſmote him for cutting off the lap of his Garment. He judged <hi>Abner</hi> worthy of Death, becauſe he had not been careful to preſerve <hi>Saul</hi>'s Life: And though <hi>David</hi> was appointed of God to be a bleſſed Inſtrument of Reformation, and <hi>Saul</hi> ſtood in his way, yet he will not deſtroy him, but waits Gods leiſure.</p>
                  <p>There were many ill Kings in <hi>Judah,</hi> but the Lord never directs private Perſons to diſown them, and dethrone and kill them.</p>

                  <p>If this Device of nullifying the Authority of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, becauſe of their faults real or alledged, were put in practice, it would quickly turn the World upſide-down. For though Magiſtrates, as Gods
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:40126:278"/> Vicegerents, be ſingularly obliged to repreſent the Holineſs and Righteouſneſs of God in the exerciſe of their Government; yet if we conſider that they have the ſame Corruption by nature which others have, and that they have greater temptations than others; and that there are often with them, men who for their own ends will tempt them to ſins, which they would never have thought upon: As for Example, That abominable Decree which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>'s Enemies cheatingly obtruded upon <hi>Darius,</hi> as a great Complement; and when they have gotten them to Enact any thing that is not right, they will alledge they are in point of Honour bound to maintain their own deed: And ſeeing there are many Flatterers, who will praiſe all that great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons do, as if it were right: And ſeeing faithful Counſellors, who ſingly deſign the Glory of God, and the true Happineſs and Intereſt of Rulers, are very rare: <q>Dum non vult alter, timet alter dicere verum, Regibus.</q> And conſidering how many provocations Rulers uſe to get by bitter invectives and ſcurrillous Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, which tend to render them contemptible; and by ſlighting and miſconſtruing their favours, and by affronting of their Authority.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being conſidered, I mean, their inward Corruption and allurements to ſin upon the one hand, and irritating Provocations upon the other hand, it's like enough that they who will nullifie their Authority, becauſe of their faults, will
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:40126:278"/> not want pretences; and they who are of this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of Depoſing Rulers, if they find not faults enough, they will make where they want; or they will magnifie their faults, and make them worſe than they are. If Men of this diſpoſition made Inſurrection againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> and alledged upon him who was the meekeſt man upon Earth, and whom God had extraordinarily raiſed up, <hi>That he lifted up himſelf above the Congregation of the Lord, and that he had brought them out of a Land flowing with Milk and Honey, to kill them in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and made himſelf altogether a Prince over them, and had not brought them unto a Land flowing with Milk and Honey, nor given them Inheritance of Fields and Vineyards: And that he would put out, or bore out their Eyes.</hi> If they found, or made ſo many pretences againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was ſo blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, O! how many faults would they find in the Perſons and Government of the generality of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, through the World in theſe laſt times, in which Iniquity does ſo much abound in Perſons of all ranks?</p>

                  <p>If the miſcarriages of Magiſtrates, Maſters, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, or the miſcarriages of Inferiours, did diſſolve the Relation, and make it void: And if the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of Married Perſons did nullifie the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-relation, and looſe the Party wronged from all Obligation towards the Party that's injurious, this would quickly diſſolve the Bonds of all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society, and make Men like a multitude of looſe Cartel.</p>
                  <p>If Subjects were not bound to give due Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Magiſtrates, except they did preſerve the true Religion, then all the Directions that Chriſt and his Apoſtles gave to Honour, and be Subject to, and pay Tribute to, and pray for the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Powers that then were, did not oblige the People to whom they were firſt directed; for all the Magiſtrates then were Infidels and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                  <p>In the Confeſſion of Faith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 23. <hi>Art.</hi> 4. It's the Duty of People to pray for Magiſtrates, to Honour their Perſons, to pay them Tribute, and other dues, to obey their Lawful Commands, and to be Subject to their Authority for Conſcience ſake. Infidelity or difference of Religion, doth not make void the Magiſtrates juſt and Legal Authority, nor free the People from their due obedience to him.</p>
                  <p>And the General Aſſembly, <hi>Anno</hi> 1639. in their Supplication to the Commiſſioner and Council, ſay, <hi>We have Solemnly ſworn, and do ſwear, not only our mutual Concurrence and Aſſiſtance for the cauſe
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:40126:280"/> of Religion; and to the utmoſt of our Power, with our Means and Lives, to ſtand to the Defence of our dread Sovereign, his Perſon and Authority, in the Preſervation of true Religion, Liberties, and Laws of this Kirk and Kingdom; but alſo in every Cauſe which may concern His Majeſties Honour, ſhall concur with our Friends and followers, as we ſhall be required.</hi>

                     <hi>Subjects are not obliged to concur with, and aſſiſt Rulers in doing ill.</hi>

                  <p>That's true; for to concur with them, in aſſiſting them to do evil, were to partake of their ſin: But though we may not partake of their evil, yet that will not follow, that we muſt not maintain their Perſon and Authority. Although the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> would not aſſiſt and concur with <hi>Saul</hi> in deſtroying <hi>Jonathan,</hi> but reſcued him, yet they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound to defend <hi>Saul</hi>'s Perſon and Authority. It's one thing not to concur with Superiours in evil, and another thing to deſtroy their Perſons and their Power, becauſe they do evil.</p>
                  <p>But ye cannot deny, but the Covenant obliges to defend and maintain the King in ſo far as he maintains the true Religion and Righteouſneſs; and I think ye will not deny that the King doth in part maintain the true Religion and Righteouſneſs, and therefore ye are bound to defend his Perſon and Authority; and how can ye defend his Perſon and Authority in doing any good, if ye deſtroy his Perſon and Power, as is deſigned and ſworn in this Band.</p>
                  <pb n="567" facs="tcp:40126:280"/>
                  <p>There are many other Abſurdities in that fourth Article of the Band, which were tedious to repeat and refute.</p>
                  <p>In the fifth Article they ſay, <hi>We then being made free by God and their own doings, he giving the Law, and they giving the tranſgreſſion of that Law, which is the cauſe that we are looſed from all Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations Divine and Civil to them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It's ſtrange that men who cry out againſt theſe who break other Articles of the Covenant, ſhould ſo boldly ſhake off the Obligation of the third Article of the Covenant, and ſo increaſe the ſin of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by adding the breach of the Civil part of the Covenant to the breach of the Religious part of it.</p>
                  <p>To make out what they aſſert, it's not enough to prove that the Rulers have tranſgreſſed the Law of God, for they muſt alſo ſhew from the Law, that it is the will of God, that Subjects ſhould upon ſuch and ſuch tranſgreſſions, ſhake off all Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards ſuch Rulers: But this they have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attempted, becauſe they could not. I would enquire at them, doth every tranſgreſſion looſe theſe Obligations? If not, then how many, and how great muſt theſe tranſgreſſions be? And then ſhall a few private Perſons, who have very little Intereſt in the Nation, determine this Queſtion, How many, and how great tranſgreſſions makes Rulers no Rulers, and Subjects no Subjects?</p>
                  <p>Then they promiſe to ſet up Government and Governours according to the Word of God, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:40126:281"/> 
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.21. <hi>Moreover, thou ſhalt provide out of all the People able Men, ſuch as fear God, Men of Truth, hating Covetouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. I wiſh they had pondered <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.21, 22. <hi>My Son, fear thou the Lord and the King, and meddle not with them that are given to change: For their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity ſhall riſe ſuddenly, and who knoweth the ruine of them both?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Interpreters expound it of theſe who are addicted to changes and novelties, departing from the Obedience which they owe to God and their Lawful Magiſtrates, and riſing up in Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> was King in <hi>Jeſurun,</hi> and his ſetting up ſubordinate Rulers, is no pattern for their ſhaking off the Yoke of Subjection, and ſetting up Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and an unlawful Government: The 16 of <hi>Numbers,</hi> where Subjects do Seditiouſly exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> quadrats better with their caſe than the 18 of <hi>Exodus,</hi> where <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> makes ſubordinate Rulers for his own and the Peoples eaſe. And how could they in Reaſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that able men, wiſe and prudent men, fit for Government, or men fearing God, or men of Truth, would undertake to be Governours over them? For wiſe men would ſee the ſin, and ſnare, and hazard in breaking down the hedge of Civil or Eccleſiaſtical Government, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.8. Men fearing God they alſo fear the King, and fear an Oath; and men of Truth will not deal falſely in the matter of their Covenant with God or Man: And who but fooliſh raſh Perſons would take upon
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:40126:281"/> them to Rule ſuch an unruly and diſorderly Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who had deſtroyed all Order Civil and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical?</p>
                  <p>It's ſtrange that they durſt ſpeak, as they do, of Kingly Government and Lineal Succeſſion, ſeeing the Lord eſtabliſhed both among his People in the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> the man after his own heart.</p>
                  <p>Kingly Government, as eſtabliſhed in theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in which King and Parliament make Laws, is a form of Government ſo excellent, that few, except Perſons byaſſed with prejudice, will find fault with it: The faults of Rulers ſhould not be imputed to the form of Government.</p>
                  <p>They engage to ſet up the Judicial Law, but they apprehend it would not reach far enough, and they reject ſome parts of it; but beſide theſe things which they mention, there are ſeveral other things, which would not ſuit with us: Some, even of their Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Laws, have intimate connexion with their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law, and derive much of their ſtrength and equity from it: By that Law Fornication in the Prieſts Daughter was Capital, and ſo was the gathering of ſticks upon the Sabbath-day; and this ſeems to be a leſſer breach of the Sabbath than the miſpending of a great part of the Lords day in drawing up Men and Horſe, and learning them how to handle their Arms; as if the Lords day had been a day of Rendevouz, or Weapon-ſhewing. The reſtoring of four or five-fold would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently reſtrain Theft in this Nation.</p>
                  <pb n="570" facs="tcp:40126:282"/>
                  <p>The Judicial Law was not given to other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. See <hi>Confeſ. of Faith, Chap.</hi> 19. <hi>Art.</hi> 4. To them alſo as a Body Politick, he gave ſundry Judicial Laws, which expired together with the Eſtate of that People, nor obliging any other now further than the general equity thereof may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour and the Apoſtles never offered to impoſe the Judicial Law upon the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſubmitted to be Judged by the <hi>Roman</hi> Law at <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Judgment-Seat, and exhorts Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of all Nations to ſubmit themſelves to the Government and wholeſom Laws of the Nations, in which they lived. There have been Hereticks, who were for reſtoring of the Judicial and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law; and ſome wild Perſons in the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> have, of late, written for this Error; and there is the more need to take heed of reſtoring the Judicial Law, becauſe of its connexion with the Ceremonial Law. This is a ſtrange Age, ſome are ſeeking to draw the World by <hi>Pelagianiſm</hi> and <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> to old <hi>Paganiſm;</hi> and ſome ſeeking to draw men under the ſhadow and vail of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are not very much concerned, though they be called <hi>Fifth-Monarchy-men.</hi> But this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of theirs is ſo ſtrange, that it is hard to find a name for it; it's rather an Anarchy and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion than a Government: And it's hoped that it will never have any ſuch proportion to the four
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:40126:282"/> Monarchies, as to get the name of a Fifth-Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy: And it is fit that ſuch a Monſtrous thing die ere it get a Name. I know nothing ſo like to it, as the Inſurrection of the Boors in <hi>Germany,</hi> who believed <hi>Thomas Munſter</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Stork,</hi> that God was ſetting up a new Kingdom, in which the Saints ſhould Reign, and that the preſent wicked Magiſtrates were to be killed, and Godly Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates ſet up in their ſtead: Theſe Teachers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Revelations and Chriſtian Liberty.</p>
                  <p>The poor People believed theſe deluſions, and rejected the wholeſom Inſtructions of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Melancthon;</hi> and in their Fury, which they imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be true Zeal, they would needs fight, but when it came to fighting, they could neither fight nor flee; and in one Summer fifty thouſand of them were killed. <hi>Munſter</hi> at his Death confeſſed his Error, and exhorted the Princes to uſe more cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency towards poor Men, and ſo they needed not fear any ſuch hazard; and withal exhorted them to read diligently the Book of the Kings.</p>
                  <p>If they who contrived this Bond of Confuſion, had conſidered the Confeſſion of Faith, and the Queſtions in the larger Catechiſm, which explain the fifth Commandment, and the Scriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the Articles of the 23d. Chapter of the Confeſſion, and the Anſwers of the fore-ſaid Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, it might have prevented this furious and mad deſign, <hi>Confeſ. Chap.</hi> 23. <hi>Art.</hi> 1. God the Supream Lord and King of all the World, hath
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:40126:283"/> ordained Civil Magiſtrates, <hi>&amp;c. Rom.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject to the Higher Powers, for there is no Power but of God; the Powers that be, are ordained of God: Whoſoever therefore reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God, and they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Pet. 2.13, 14. <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of Man for the Lords ſake, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be to the King as Supream,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Art.</hi> 4. It's the Duty of People to pray for Magiſtrates, to Honour their Perſons, to pay them Tribute, and other dues, to Obey their Lawful Commands, and to be Subject to their Authority, for Conſcience ſake.</p>
                  <p>Infidelity or difference of Religion doth not make void the Magiſtrates Juſt and Legal Authority, nor free the People from their due Obedience to him, from which Eccleſiaſtical Perſons are not exempted; much leſs hath the Pope any Power or Juriſdiction over them in their Dominions, or over any of their People; and leaſt of all, to deprive them of their Dominions or Lives, if he ſhall judge them to be Hereticks, or upon any other pretence whatſoever. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>I exhort therefore that firſt of all, Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſions, and giving of Thanks be made for all Men, for Kings, and for all that are in Authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable Life, in all Godlineſs and Honeſty.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.17.

                  <p>If we compare this Band with the Confeſſion of Faith, and Catechiſms, and the Covenants, and the Scriptures which are cited in the Confeſſion of Faith, and larger Catechiſm, we may ſee, if we
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:40126:285"/> will not ſhut our eyes, that this Band cannot be reconciled with theſe, but manifeſtly claſheth with them; and therefore they who adhere to this Band, are a party who by their tenets and practices, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh themſelves from theſe, who do adhere to the Confeſſion of Faith, Catechiſms, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.</p>
                  <p>I had forgot that they alſo deſign themſelves Perſons whom the Magiſtrate hath declared no Lawful Subjects, which ſhews, that their number is not great, and yet there are many who fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the laſh of theſe Declarations, who think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound by the Covenants to maintain the Kings Perſon and Authority; and who diſclaimed <hi>Ruglen</hi> Declaration, and would undergo a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Deaths, ere they ſubſcribed this Band: And it's hoped that the Magiſtrates will think it true Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy to put a difference betwixt theſe who own their Authority, and theſe who diſown it.</p>
                  <p>This ſhews how inconſiderable the number of theſe who own this Band are, and how unfit they are to make a Repreſentative of the true Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Church and Covenanted Nation of <hi>Scotland.</hi>

                  <pb n="577" facs="tcp:40126:285"/>
                  <p>Very ordinarily they who are for deſtroying Magiſtrates, are no great friends to Miniſters: Having rejected the Magiſtrates in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Articles, they fall upon the Miniſters in the ſixth Article, at leaſt the greater part of them, as being defective in preaching and teſtifying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Acts of the Rulers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then for hindring others who were willing to have teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was a long time a myſtery to many what ſome people meant by a teſtimony, which they were always calling for; becauſe although Miniſters plainly preached as their Text led them, againſt Prelacy and Eraſtianiſm: and did ſhew the people from the Scripture, that God hath given the keys of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Miniſters, and not to Magiſtrates; and that the things of the Houſe of God, Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical matters, muſt be done according to the will of the God of Heaven, and not according to the will of the Magiſtrate. And though they with grief regrated the breaches made in the Order and Government of the Church, yet theſe people would ſtill exclaim againſt them, as not bearing teſtimony againſt the ills of the time: but at length it appeared what was the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which they meant: for if one inſtead of preaching the Goſpel, had made an invective di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe againſt the Rulers, and treated them at the rate that they are treated in this band, and ſo rendred them and their Authority deſpicable and hateful; O! that was a preaching of the whole counſel of God, though they brought nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scripture nor Reaſon for what they ſaid, and
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:40126:286"/> they made nothing of what was brought from Scripture and Reaſon againſt <hi>Prelacy</hi> and <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianiſm,</hi> by other Miniſters, becauſe they alſo did preach the duty which ſubjects owed to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, and maintained their lawful Authority, as Gods Ordinance; and prayed for the King and ſubordinate Magiſtrates.</p>
                  <p>The Teſtimony which ſome of theſe people, who were upon the ſecret which hath now bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out, were ſeeking, was ſomething which might render the Magiſtrate hateful, and caſt him out of the affections of the ſubjects, and ſo make way for driving on the deſign which is now diſcovered in this band and declaration, <hi>viz.</hi> the rejection of the King and Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all ſubordinate Magiſtrates deriving their Authority from the King.</p>
                  <p>They are highly injurious to <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, in alledging that they have not born te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to that truth which Chriſt witneſſed before <hi>Pontius Pilate, viz.</hi> That Chriſt is a King: for they declare it privately and publickly in their places and ſtations, That Chriſt is a King, and that he hath a ſpiritual Kingdom diſtinct from the Kingdoms of this world, but no ways prejudicial to earthly Kingdoms; but where it comes into any Kingdom of this world, it is, if it be received, the eſtabliſhment of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>Not to repeat what is ſaid in ſeveral Papers, which do ſhew the ſeveral ſorts of teſtimonies both verbal and real, given by <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, I ſhall only ſay, That their teſtimony
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:40126:286"/> concerning the Church and the Government thereof, and the power of the Magiſtrate in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Church-matters, is in the Confeſſion of their Faith and Catechiſms, Directory for Worſhip and Government; and as it could hardly be expected that theſe Miniſters, being ſo ſcattered, could meet to agree upon new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions; ſo though they had met, they could not readily have fallen upon a better confeſſion than what is already extant, and to which they add here.</p>
                  <p>In chap. 25. of the <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> Art. 2. it is aſſerted, <hi>That the viſible Church is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Houſe and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of God</hi>— Art. 3. <hi>Unto this Catholick viſible Church Chriſt hath given the Miniſtry, Oracles and Ordinances of God, for gathering and perfecting of the Saints.</hi> Art. 6. <hi>There is no other head of the Church but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Chap 30. <hi>The Lord Jeſus as King and Head of his Church, hath therein appointed a government in the hand of Church-Officers, diſtinct from the Civil Magiſtrate.</hi> Art. 2. <hi>To theſe Officers the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven are committed</hi>—Chap. 31. Art. 3. <hi>It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Synods and Councils miniſterially to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine controverſies of Faith, and caſes of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; to ſet down Rules and Directions for the better ordering of the publick Worſhip of God, and government of his Church.</hi> Art. 5. <hi>Synods and Councils are to conclude nothing but that which is Eccleſiaſtical, and are not to meddle with Civil af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, which concern the Commonwealth, unleſs by way of humble petition, in caſes extraordinary; or
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:40126:287"/> by way of advice for ſatisfaction of conſcience, if they be thereto required by the Civil Magiſtrate.</hi> Chap. 23. Art. 3. <hi>The Civil Magiſtrate may not aſſume to himſelf the adminiſtration of word and Sacraments, as the power of the keys of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven; yet he hath authority, and it is his duty to take order that unity and peace be preſerved in the Church, that the truth of God be kept pure and intire; that all blaſphemies and hereſies be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, all corruptions and abuſes in worſhip or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline prevented or reformed, and all Ordinances of God duly ſetled, adminiſtred, and obſerved, for the better effecting whereof, he hath power to call Synods, to be preſent at them, and to provide that whatſoever is tranſacted in them, be according to the word of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Articles, and the Scripture-proofs, do clearly hold out, and confirm, That Chriſt, not the Magiſtrate, is the Head, King, Lord of the Church, which is the Body, Houſe, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt; that Church, and not the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, is the Fountain of the Spiritual Power of the keys of the kingdom of Heaven; that the Offices in the Church are of divine inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, given by Chriſt; and that theſe Offices which Chriſt hath given, are ſufficient for ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering and perfecting the Church, ſeeing he hath given them for that end, and that they are Miniſterial, and not Lordly; and hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the Office of a Prelate (who claims a majority of Directive and Coercive power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Miniſters, who not only takes upon him, without election, to moderate Synods, but alſo
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:40126:287"/> is above the cenſure of the Synod, and who can hinder the Synod from concluding any thing, how neceſſary ſoever they find it, and without whoſe Authority the Synod is no Synod; who impoſes Moderators upon the meetings for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, and to whom theſe meetings are counta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for their actings, without whom there can be no ordination, depoſition, excommunication, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation from it, who exacteth an Oath of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical obedience from Miniſters) not being in the Rolls of the Offices and Officers given by Chriſt; and being a Lordly, and ſo more than a Miniſterial Office, <hi>Presbyterians</hi> cannot own it, nor judg it uſeful for gathering or perfecting of the Church. They ſhew alſo, that the Magiſtrate to whom God hath given the Lordly power of the ſword, is ſo far from having a ſpiritual Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power of the keys of the kingdom of heaven, that he hath not the power of the keys of the kingdom of heaven given to him at all; for the power of the keys which Chriſt hath given, is Miniſterial, and makes thoſe who are inveſted with it, Miniſters of the Church; but the power of the Sword is Magiſtratical, and a Lordly Dominion; and that it belongs to Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods and Councils, and not to Magiſtrates, to make Eccleſiaſtical Rules, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that none, neither Magiſtrates nor Miniſters, may order Eccleſiaſtical matters according to their mind and pleaſure; but thoſe things muſt be ordered according to the mind and will of God reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his word.</p>
                  <pb n="582" facs="tcp:40126:288"/>
                  <p>And all true <hi>Presbyterians</hi> believe, That ſeeing both the Lordly Power of the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and in ſpecial the Kingly Power, and the <hi>Miniſterial Power</hi> of <hi>Church-Officers</hi> are of God, and his Ordinances, that they are not contrary to one another; for the Ordinances of God do not juſtle one againſt another, but ſweetly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; and any juſtling or claſhing which hath proceeded from the corruptions of <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> or <hi>Miniſters,</hi> are not to be imputed to the Lords Ordinances; and it's the earneſt deſire of all truly godly and loyal ſubjects, who ſeek the glory of God, and the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> true honour and intereſt, That whatſoever in the actings of their rightful <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> hath exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the bounds which the Lord hath ſet to them, may be in mercy diſcovered to them, and in time reformed. That all occaſions of grief and ſtumbling may be taken out of the way of truly loyal ſubjects; and all occaſion of doing miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief may be cut off from thoſe who take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from thoſe exceſſes to render the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate</hi> contemptible, and to overthrow that Power which they have from God.</p>
                  <p>As for what they ſay of <hi>Miniſters</hi> hindering thoſe who would have given a teſtimony, and cenſuring others who did give it; the truth is, <hi>Presbyterian Miniſters</hi> endeavoured to reſtrain ſome young men, who inſtead of preaching the Goſpel, made it their work to revile the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,</hi> and <hi>Miniſters,</hi> who made uſe of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty granted by the <hi>Magiſtrate;</hi> but theſe youths diſcovered themſelves not to be of
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:40126:288"/> 
                     <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Principles, by their refuſing to be ſubordinate to the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and by reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them who would have reclaimed them from their diſorderly and Schiſmatick practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. By this the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> may perceive if the <hi>Presbyterian Miniſters,</hi> who are <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, had by allowance of the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> the peaceable exerciſe of their <hi>Ministry,</hi> and liberty of meeting for regulating their own actings, and the actings of thoſe who profeſs themſelves to be <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> ſuch unruly perſons who ſtir up the people to Schiſm and Sedition, would not be admitted to the <hi>Ministry;</hi> or if they, after their admiſſion, diſcovered themſelves to be of pernicious principles, they would be put from the <hi>Ministry,</hi> and ſo the people who are true to <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Principles, would not own them, and ſo they would not have acceſs to pervert the people with Seditious and Schiſmatick doctrine; this would be found the moſt proper Remedy for theſe diſtempers. But what wonder is it, if young men, who are ordinarily raſh, being but Novices, who have not ſtudied the Body of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and who have no experience, and know not the Principles and Practices of <hi>Presbyterial</hi> Government, who are not put ro <hi>Presbyterial</hi> Exerciſes for their trial and inſtruction, and who it may be have never ſeen any thing of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of <hi>Presbyterial</hi> Government in Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or Synods, and who are not under the i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of meetings of <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> but wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to and fro at random, not thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves accountable to any meeting of <hi>Ministers,</hi>
                     <pb n="584" facs="tcp:40126:289"/> nor cenſurable by any. What wonder is it, if ſuch perſons, when they are blown up with the vain applauſe of ſome ignorant and humorous people, who under their ſad ſufferings have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up ſuch prejudice againſt the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> and all to whom the <hi>Magistrate</hi> ſhews any favour, that they think what is moſt croſs to the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,</hi> is moſt right; and any thing which the <hi>Magistrate</hi> allows, they think it wrong; and ſo they cry up thoſe Preachers moſt who ſpeak moſt invectively againſt the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe <hi>Ministers</hi> to whom the <hi>Magistrate</hi> ſhews any favour. I ſay, what wonder is it if ſuch youths, blown up with the wind of popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar applauſe, fall into many ſnares, and take courſes that tend to bring all things ſacred and civil into confuſion. They add, <hi>For which, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with other cauſes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>we may ſay God hath left them to do worſe things</hi>— This is among their raſh ſayings; it was the duty of <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> to cenſure ſuch unruly youths. They add, <hi>But alſo have voted in that meeting which they are pleaſed to call an Aſſembly of Ministers, but how justly, let men judg, an acceptation of that liberty founded upon, and given by virtue of that blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly arrogated and uſurped power</hi>— Their alledgance that that meeting is not to be called an Aſſembly of Miniſters, will beget no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice againſt it in the minds of men who have any ſound judgment in matters of that nature. And ſober and judicious men would have ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that meeting, if it had pleaſed their ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or any of ſuch principles as they maintain.
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:40126:289"/> And none except ignorants, or perſons blinded with prejudice, will ſay that the liberty of the peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry, granted by the Magiſtrate, is founded upon any unlawful pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, or ſupremacy. The Magiſtrates granting liberty of the peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry, is the exerciſe of that power which the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate hath from God. That which the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ought to do, doth not flow from any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful power, but the Magiſtrate ought to grant to the Miniſters of the Goſpel liberty to exerciſe their Miniſtry peaceably; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch a grant of liberty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or ſuch liberty granted, doth not flow from, nor is founded upon any unlawful or uſurped power or ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy. They add, <hi>And hath appeared before their Courts to accept of that liberty, and to be Enacted and authorized there as Miniſters, and ſo hath willingly (for this is an elicite act of the will, and not an act of force and conſtraint) tranſlated the power of ſending out, ordering, cenſuring; for as they accept of their liberty from them, ſo they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to their cenſures and reſtraints, at leaſt all of them who were yet tried with it; and others of them appeared and acknowledged before their Courts, that they would not have done theſe things that they were charged with, if they had thought it would have offended them. Miniſters departing from the Court of Chriſt, and ſubjection to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry to the Courts of men, and ſubjection to the Magiſtrate (which had been impious and injurious to Chriſt and his Church, though they had been righteous and lawful rulers; and by their changing
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:40126:290"/> of Courts according to common Law, hath changed their maſters; and of the Miniſters of Chriſt are become the Miniſters of men, and bound to anſwer to them as oft as they will; and as by the accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this liberty in ſuch manner, they have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated the power, ſo they have given up and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quit the Government, and a ſucceſſion of a</hi> Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian <hi>Miniſtry; for as theſe were not granted them of their maſters, ſo they exerciſe their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry without them, and ſo by this as the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Government is ſwallowed up in the Civil, if the reſt had followed them, the Miniſtry ſhould have alſo been extinct with themſelves, and the whole work of Reformation had been buried in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion, not ſo much as the remembrance of it kept up.</hi> —</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> If the Magiſtrates will ſee theſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, for whom the people ſupplicate, why ſhould they refuſe to appear? what ſolid reaſon can be given for ſuch a refuſal? and what ill is there in the Councils recording in their Act, that upon ſuch a day, ſuch a Miniſter, for whom ſuch a Pariſh had ſupplicated, was allowed to Preach in ſuch a Pariſh? That they appeared to be authorized as Miniſters, if they mean, as it ſeems they do, that they appeared to receive their Miniſterial authority from the Council, or that they appeared to be made Miniſters of the Goſpel, it is a manifeſt ſlander; for as they had their Miniſterial authority before their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance before the Council, ſo the Council did not pretend to make them Miniſters, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed that they were Miniſters, by enquiring
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:40126:290"/> where they were Ordained Miniſters; and the Council cannot well be blamed, to inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves concerning the perſons whom they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Preach, that they may not allow they know not whom, but may be aſſured that they are Miniſters, and that they are not ſeditious, turbulent perſons. But if by authorizing, they mean the Magiſtrates Civil allowance, mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, protection; it's the Magiſtrates duty thus to authorize thoſe who are Ordained Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel in the publick exerciſe of the Spiritual power and authority of their Office, as all Orthodox Anti-Eraſtian Divines grant.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the Authors of this Band ſeem to have been unacquainted with the judgment of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Divines in theſe matters, I ſhall for their information, and the information of others, who are bold to ſpeak of things which they do not underſtand, ſet down the judgment of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Divines in this matter, as it is holden forth in that famous Book, <hi>The Divine right of Church-Government,</hi> Chap. 6. Pag. 55.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The power or authority of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a derived power: for clearing of this, note there is a Magiſterial, primitive, ſupreme power, which is peculiar to Jeſus Chriſt our Mediator, as hath been proved,</hi> Chap. 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5; <hi>and there is a Miniſterial, derivative, ſubordinate power, which the Scripture declares to be in Church-guides,</hi> Mat. 16.19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18.18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20, 21, 23. Mat. 28.19, 20. 2 Cor. 10.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13.10. <hi>and often elſewhere, this is abundantly teſtified; but whence is this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er originally derived to them? here we are carefully
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:40126:291"/> to conſider, and diſtinguiſh three things touching this power and authority from one another,</hi> viz. 1. <hi>The Donation of the authority it ſelf, and of the Offices whereunto this power doth properly belong.</hi> 2. <hi>The deſignation of particular perſons unto ſuch Offices as are veſted with ſuch power.</hi> 3. <hi>The pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick protection, countenancing, authorizing, defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, maintaining of ſuch Officers in the publick exerciſe of ſuch power, within ſuch and ſuch Realms and Dominions; this being premiſed, we may clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus reſolve, according to Scripture-warrant,</hi> viz. <hi>the deſignation or ſetting apart of particular indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual perſons to thoſe Offices in the Church, that have power and authority engraven upon them, is from the Church, nominating, electing and ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch perſons thereunto.</hi> See <hi>Act.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. 1 Tim. 4.4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.22. Tit. 1.5. Act. 4.22.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The publick defence, maintenance, &amp;c. of ſuch Officers in the publick exerciſe of the power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their Office, in ſuch and ſuch Dominions, is from the Civil Magiſtrate, as the nurſing Father of the Church,</hi> Iſa. 49.23. <hi>For it is by his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and ſanction, that ſuch publick places ſhall be ſet apart for publick Miniſtry, that ſuch mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and reward ſhall be legally performed for ſuch Miniſtry; that all ſuch perſons, of ſuch and ſuch Congregations, ſhall be (in caſe they neglect their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſuch Miniſtry) puniſhed with ſuch Political penalties, &amp;c. But the donation of the Office and ſpiritual authority annexed thereunto, is only deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Jeſus Chriſt our Mediator, he alone gives all Church-Officers, and therefore none may deviſe or ſuperadd any new Officers,</hi> Epheſ. 4.7, 8, 10, 11.
<pb n="985" facs="tcp:40126:291"/> 1 Cor. 12.28. <hi>And he alone derives all authority and power Spiritual to theſe Officers, for diſpenſing the Word, Sacraments, Cenſures, and all Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> Mat. 16.19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 28.18, 19, 20. Joh. 20.21, 22, 23. 2 Cor. 10.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13.10. <hi>and therefore it is not ſafe for any creature to intrude upon this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative Royal of Chriſt to give any power to any Officer of the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus we ſee that theſe Learned and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miniſters, who ſolidly in that ſame Book re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute Eraſtianiſm, yet aſſert that it belongs to the Magiſtrate to protect, countenance, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize, defend, maintain Miniſters in the publick exerciſe of their Miniſtry which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Lord Jeſus. But it's the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the ſolid writings of <hi>Presbyterians</hi> which makes ſome folks ſo confident, that they are true <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and adhering to <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Principles, when in the mean time they are publiſhing to the world, that they are ſtrangers to the ſolid writings of ſound <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> And there is no Orthodox Divine who would find fault with theſe Miniſters, who when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before the Council, did give humble thanks to the Kings Majeſty, and the Lords of his Majeſties Council, for the peaceable exerciſe of the Miniſtry which they had received from the Lord Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>The elicite act of the Will is too Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal for common people to ſubſcribe or ſwear to, for they can hardly be made to underſtand it. And what they ſay concerning it, is not Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical enough to be approven by thoſe who
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:40126:292"/> underſtand what an elicite act is; for elicite acts of the Will are ſuch as immediately flow from the Will, as love or hatred, volition, or nolition. Now tranſlation of power from Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to Magiſtrates, is not made by theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts of the Will, but by ſome external im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate acts, as ſpeaking, writing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Politick acts of ſurrender, or tranſlation of power, are not effectuate by meer elicite internal acts of the Will. But their ignorance of the nature of an elicite act of the <hi>Will,</hi> and their oppoſing acts of force and conſtraint to elicite acts; whereas elicite acts uſe to be contra-diſtinguiſhed from imperate acts; and their inſinuating, That if an act be not an elicite act of the <hi>Will,</hi> it is an act of force and conſtraint; whereas the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate acts of the <hi>Will</hi> are not elicite acts, and yet being commanded by the <hi>Will,</hi> they are not acts of force and conſtraint; theſe are more harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs miſtakes. But it is a very injurious calumny, that thoſe Miniſters who appeared before the Council tranſlated the power of ſending out, ordering and cenſuring Miniſters to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; It's a ridiculous ignorant conceit to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that what theſe Miniſters did in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the Council, was a tranſlation of the power of order, of Poteſtative miſſion, or elſe ſuch cenſuring to the Magiſtrate, or changing their Maſter, and making themſelves the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of men, and a quitting of the Government and ſucceſſion of a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſtry.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are meer calumnies, and ridiculous fopperies, that none who underſtand any thing
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:40126:292"/> in theſe matters, will think worthy of any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. They were very injurious to the poor people, many of whom are ſimple and ready through prejudice to believe any ill word ſpoken againſt indulged Miniſters, who in their Papers and Pamphlets abuſed them with ſuch ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. But they are more injurious to them, who would have them to ſubſcribe and ſwear ſuch injurious calumnies, and ridiculous foppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which are not only far from truth, but from any appearance of truth. And ſo much hath been ſaid in ſeveral Papers written in vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the practice of the Indulged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that it were to waſte time and paper to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer any more to theſe Calumniators; and the beſt anſwer to them, is to pray, that the Lord would give them repentance for theſe abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reproaches, whereby they have very active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly driven on the deſign of Satan, and his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Quakers,</hi> &amp;c. which is to render the Miniſtry contemptible. And it was ſeen and told long ago, that they would not reſt ſatisfied with the reproachieg of a few Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, but would proceed to render all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible. The contrivers of this Bond have made a great progreſs in this Deviliſh work of rendering Miniſters contemptible and uſeleſs; for they have caſten all, except ſome few, who for any thing known, did not exceed the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of four, and ſome think that they were but three at moſt, and one of them was caſten by the other two.</p>
                  <pb n="592" facs="tcp:40126:293"/>
                  <p>It is ſtrange that any perſon who had the uſe of reaſon, could be ſo far blinded with preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, as to think that theſe Miniſters did tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate the power of ſending out Miniſters, or the power of Poteſtative miſſion to the Magiſtrate; for, as was ſaid, the Magiſtrate ſuppoſed them to be Ordained miniſters, and ſo to have a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtative miſſion to Preach the Goſpel already; for miniſters are poteſtatively ſent to preach the Goſpel, when they are Ordained miniſters; &amp; this clearly appeared by the Councils inquiring, if they were, and where, or by whom they were Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained miniſters; if the Council had called ſome perſons who were not Ordained, and ſent them to Preach and Baptize, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then they might have alledged that the Magiſtrate did aſſume the power of ſending out miniſters, or of a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtative miſſion; but they never pretended to any thing like that.</p>

Ye may read the Hiſtory in <hi>Zozomens</hi> Church-Hiſtory, <hi>Book</hi> 5. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.—where he ſhews, that he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted the Church in all things moſt bitterly and grievouſly, except that he recalled the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Prieſts which were baniſhed in the time of <hi>Conſtantius;</hi> and that it was ſaid, he gave not that command out of mercy or pity; but that either they by their mutual contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might fight againſt the Church by an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine War, and ſo fall away from their own Laws and Inſtitutions, or that he might wrong the Eſtimation of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> and might raiſe up hatred againſt him through the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>As for what they ſay of Miniſters ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the Magiſtrates cenſures, and ſaying they would not have done the things they were charged with, if they had thought it would have offended them; it's a confuſed charge, and it is not eaſie to gueſs what they mean; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove, that any of thoſe Miniſters have done
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:40126:295"/> any thing that will import an acknowledgment, that the Magiſtrate hath power of inflicting Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick Cenſures, or of making Eccleſiaſtick Canons. And as for Civil Reſtraints of Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment and Baniſhment, if they condemn ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to theſe, they will condemn all who have been impriſoned and baniſhed; and among the reſt the Miniſters who went to <hi>Holland,</hi> who did not only paſſively ſubmit to Baniſhment, but alſo by their Subſcription engaged not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
                  <p>If any Miniſter hath done any thing which warrantably might have been forborn, or which might have been done as conveniently, or more conveniently at another time, in another place, in a way that would not have irritated or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the magiſtrate; if ſuch a perſon hath made the foreſaid acknowledgment, who can with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon condemn it; for we owe thus much even to any private perſon, whom we ſhould not needleſly provoke to anger if we can conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently help it: but the contrivers of this bond, and thoſe who go their way, are for needleſs provocations of the magiſtrate; and if there be many ways of doing what is right upon the matter, they will chuſe the way that is irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Rulers, becauſe it is irritating; and ſhun that way which will not provoke the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate; as if it were a duty to provoke the magiſtrate to wrath. And if any have needleſly provoked them, they will not allow him to give an innocent ſoft anſwer to turn away their wrath. But it is no wonder that they who are
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:40126:296"/> for overthrowing the magiſtrate and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, be againſt all things that make for peace with them, or may tend to pacifie them when they are angry, and be for grievous words and things, which may ſtir up ſtrife, and put evil betwixt the magiſtrate and ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>What they add, That theſe miniſters have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the Courts of Chriſt, and ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the miniſtry, are meer calumnies. Do they think that miniſters appearing before the magiſtrate when called, that by the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates Civil allowance of the peaceable exerciſe of the miniſtry, they might without diſturbance preach the Goſpel in ſuch or ſuch places, will prove that theſe miniſters have departed from the Courts of Chriſt, and have changed their Courts, and ſo by common Law have changed their maſters, and are become, of the miniſters of Chriſt, the miniſters of men. Theſe are meer forgeries, that have no foundation but in their own fancy; nor any conſonancy with common Law, but are againſt common ſenſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>Although theſe miniſters had bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to anſwer when the magiſtrate would, it had been no more than men who compear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the magiſtrate uſe to do when required, that till they be called, they may in the mean time have their freedom. Now the peaceable exerciſe of the miniſtry, is in many reſpects pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to Civil liberty. But it was the people, and not the miniſter, who gave bond to the Council, to preſent the miniſter when called,
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:40126:296"/> under ſuch a penalty. It's another groundleſs ſlander, that they have given up, and utterly quit the Government, and a ſucceſſion of a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſtry: for they have not by their making uſe of this liberty, bound up themſelves from doing any thing in their places and ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which they might have done before, for the Government of the Church, and ſucceſſion of a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſtry; and it's but a melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dream to imagine that the ſetled, fixed, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able exerciſe of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection, of lawful authority, does ſwallow up the Government of the Church, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the Miniſtry, and bury the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Is not the Preaching of the Goſpel a part of the exerciſe of Chriſts viſible Kingdom? Does the exerciſe of the Miniſtry deſtroy the Miniſtry? Or does the Preaching of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Reformed Churches, bury the work of Reformation?</p>
                  <p>Next, they charge theſe Miniſters with Preaching the lawfulneſs of paying that tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute declared to be impoſed for the bearing down of the true Worſhip of God which they falſely termed ſeditious Conventicles.</p>

                  <p>I wiſh thoſe who Preached againſt the paying of it, had made leſs haſte, and had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:40126:297"/> with their Brethren, and heard what they had to ſay from Scripture and Reaſon, e're they had adventured to preach ſuch a new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, That ſubjects ſhould not pay a tribute, which was concluded by a meeting of the Eſtates of the Nation, and for an end which is unqueſtionably good, the reſiſting of foreign Invaſion.</p>
                  <p>It's, I ſuppoſe, a new Doctrine, That ſubjects ſhould not pay tribute; and the preaching of new Doctrines is dangerous; it hath been the raſhneſs of ſome that they were too haſty to preach their own private and very ſingular opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; it were good, Miniſters of the Goſpel would forbear to ſay any thing to the people in preaching, but that of which they might ſay, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord.</hi> They ſhould have conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what danger they expoſed the people to by this Doctrine: for either thoſe who believed this Doctrine would perſiſt in refuſing to pay, and this would expoſe them to be eaten up by Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; or they being diſtreſſed, would at length pay it, though they thought it unlawful, and this would deboſh and waſte their Conſciences, and prepare them to do other things which they thought unlawful; and this would encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage thoſe who differed from them in other things, to take the ſame method in preſſing them to conform to them; and ſome of the poor people who have ſtood out long, and at length yielded to pay, have expoſed themſelves to the ſcorn and deriſion of thoſe who uplifted that Seſs.</p>

                  <p>Any who reads this part of the Band, and had not ſeen the Act of the Convention of Eſtates, would think that they had declared, that it was for bearing down the true Worſhip of God; now there are no ſuch words in the Act of Convention. Again, any who had not ſeen the Act, might think that if their words were true, that then the Convention of States were for bearing down whatſoever was the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God; or that there was no true worſhip of God but in theſe meetings which the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate calls ſeditious Conventicles. We ſhould not make either words or things worſe than they really are; and we ſhould at leaſt deal as fairly with the Magiſtrate as with other men.</p>
                  <p>It hath been reported by perſons of Honour, and of great candor, that the motion of ſetting up Prelacy (which hath been the cauſe of the ſad ſuffering of <hi>Presbyterians</hi>) in <hi>Scotland,</hi> did not come of the Kings Majeſty, but was repell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the King, when firſt moved by ſome <hi>Scots men;</hi> and if they who moved it, had not vehemently inſiſted, and ſtrongly alledged, that it would be eaſily effectuate, and would be acceptable to the people of <hi>Scoland,</hi> the King would never have ſet up Prelacy in <hi>Scotland.</hi> And any favour that hath been ſhewed to Non-conformiſts, hath principally flowed from the King himſelf; as Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> in his Anſwer to Dr.
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:40126:298" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                     <hi>Stillingfleets</hi> Sermon declareth. And in ſome places of his Majeſties Dominions, <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have the publick worſhip of God without any diſturbance; which ſhews, that the King doth not look upon all the Meetings of <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> for the worſhip of God, as ſeditious Conventicles; ſo that ſuppoſe that were ſaid (which yet no ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious perſon will alledge) that there were no true worſhip of God, except in theſe Meetings which are called Conventicles; it would not be alledged, that it were the Magiſtrates deſign to bear down the true worſhip of God, ſeeing theſe Meetings in ſeveral places of theſe Kingdoms are not ſuppreſſed; and if ſome Preachers had not vented Doctrines which were really ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous at ſome of thoſe Conventicles, <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſters and people, who deſigned nothing but the preaching and hearing of the Goſpel of peace, would not have been moleſted as they were; but the ſeditious turbulent Doctrine of ſome, did breed much trouble to others, who were innocent.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be denied, that there were ſome Meetings where ſuch Doctrine was taught by the Preachers, and applauded and practiſed by hearers, that it was no wonder that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate called them ſeditious. And if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers of this Bond, had ſet themſelves to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe a way to confirm the Magiſtrate, in calling Conventicles ſeditious, they could not have fallen upon a more effectual way, than this Contrivance; which is indeed ſeditious, and will readily be imputed to many who abhor the ſeditious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:40126:298"/> and principles which are in this Bond.</p>
                  <p>As for the reaſon why this Seſs ſhould not be paid, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it's declared to be impoſed for an ill end; they who are free to pay it, will retort, It's impoſed for a good end, <hi>viz.</hi> to put the Kingdom in a poſture of defence againſt Invaſion; and therefore it ſhould be payed. I know a judicious Gentleman, who ſaid he would pay his Seſs for that end, which was unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably good, <hi>viz.</hi> the reſiſting of Foreign In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion. If an ill deſign intended by thoſe who lay on a Seſs, render the paying of it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, then ſuppoſe a Magiſtrate ſhould impoſe a Seſs for twenty neceſſary ends and uſes, if there were but one ill end deſigned by him in impoſing it, it would be unlawful for Subjects to pay that which is neceſſary for twenty good ends and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which were very abſurd. If the Payer have no ill deſign in paying, the Magiſtrates ill deſign in impoſing will not vitiate the Act of him that pays. Suppoſe a Robber ſay to a travelling man, I and my men muſt live, and therefore I require you to give me out of your hand ſo much money to maintain me and my men, or elſe I will kill you, and take all the money ye have; the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller would not be guilty of the abuſing of the money to maintain Robbers; he gives it not for that end, but to preſerve his life; and gives a part to preſerve the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt commanded to give Tribute to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, which was exacted by the <hi>Romans</hi> to maintain the Government over the <hi>Jews,</hi> which was deſtructive both to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:40126:299"/> and Civil Liberties. <hi>Paul</hi> directs to give Tribute to thoſe who were then Magiſtrates, who were Heathen Idolaters. Now the Lord hath declared in his word, That every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed man ſerves divers Luſts and pleaſures, and makes proviſion for the fleſh to fulfil the Luſts of it; they are Idolaters, make their belly or their Riches, or their Pleaſures, their God; they act from carnal Principles, and for carnal ends. They who pay the Seſs, are not certain that the Magiſtrate will imploy it for bearing down Conventicles, they may put it to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe; they might get ſome other thing to do with it; but we are certain, that Heathen Rulers, Idolaters, and every unrenewed man will ſerve his Luſts with the Tribute, or Rent, or Debt that is paid to him; or with the Alms that is given to him in his diſtreſs; and yet Subjects are commanded to pay Tribute to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ungodly Emperors; and Tenants and Debtors ſhould pay their Rent and Debts to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Landlords and Creditors, though they declared when they were requiring it, that they had a mind to miſimploy it to ſome ill uſe; if the Declaration of the Magiſtrate, that he will abuſe the Tribute, make it ſure that he will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe it, and ſo bar Subjects from paying; the Declaration of the God of Truth, That every ungodly, unrenewed man will abuſe what is payed to him, or given him out of charity, is much ſurer; and ſo men would be bound up to pay or give any thing to any perſon that were in an unrenewed ſtate; and thus we ſhould
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:40126:299"/> be obliged to defraud ungodly men, in not pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them their Debts; and to let Heathens, Pagans, and ungodly poor people ſtarve; becauſe we know from the Scripture, that they will make what they get, Proviſion for their Luſts, which they ſerve, and offer it to ſome Idol-luſt; this were a new method of effectuating what ſome of the furious Anabaptiſts deſigned, to kill all the wicked, that there might be none but Saints in the World.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall add the words of another <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſter, <hi>Edward Gee</hi> Miniſter in <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> in his excellent Treatiſe of the <hi>Divine Right and Original of the Civil Magiſtrate,</hi> publiſhed <hi>Anno</hi> 1658. pag. 368. where he is ſhewing what may be lawfully done by people under the power of an Uſurper. He ſays, 2. <hi>And therewithal ſuch as are peculiarly ariſing from that ſtate of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duedneſs, as the neceſſity that is incumbent to do, or part with the thing required, for the avoidance of greater loſs, or ſuffering to come; if the Subject de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect it, or the greater conveniency, ſafety or emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument, which there is to ones ſelf, to his Neighbour, or to the publick, in doing them, in denying, as the circumſtances of the Impoſal lye, though were it not ſo impoſed, it would not be eligible; though we are obliged to nothing</hi> juſſu ejus, <hi>or upon the intuition of his Command, yet we may do many things,</hi> eo jubente, <hi>he commanding; and ſhould do,</hi> eo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente, <hi>he inforcing them; and we have many things to do,</hi> ipſo ſeu volente, ſeu nolente, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will, or forbid the doing of them,</hi> &amp;c. By which paſſages it appears, That thoſe godly learned <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in thoſe Treatiſes, which they wrote of purpoſe to maintain the Kings Authority when he was thruſt from it; and to
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:40126:301"/> ſhew that the Subject might do nothing which might prejudge his right; or which might be interpreted to be an owning of the title of the then Uſurpers, who had forced the King out of his Dominions; yet they ſhew, that Taxes might be paid to the Uſurpers; and that they who payed it, were not accountable for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe that the Uſurpers made of it; which lets us ſee how far they would have been from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſig to pay Tribute to the rightful Magiſtrate, though impoſed for ſome wrong end. And I cannot but here take notice, how conſtantly and courageouſly <hi>Presbyterians</hi> owned the Kings Authority, when he was thruſt from the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it; and how careful they were, that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects might do nothing which might be prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to his Title, when he was violently diſpoſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of his Kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not ſpeak of the Teſtimonies they gave in preaching and in print, againſt the Uſurpers, upon the account of their uſurpation, and for aſſerting of the Kings Title. I wiſh their Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty had been better remembred; but any ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering they have met with ſince, will not make them repent of their conſtant adherence, from a principle of Conſcience to their Allegiance, and covenanted Duty to their rightful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign.</p>
                  <p>If any will but look to the frontiſpiece of Mr. <hi>Gee's</hi> Book, where there is an empty Chair of State, and the Scepter and Crown lying upon the ground; and below, the King ſtanding, and above his head, <hi>non eſt poteſtas niſi a Deo,</hi> Rom. 13.

They may ſee <hi>Presbyterians</hi> Loyalty and courage in a time of hazard; when others, who afterward would have engroſſed all Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to themſelves, were very calm; and ſome of them ſpeaking in another Dialect.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> uſed to keep Family-faſts, to pray for the King in his diſtreſs. There is no Loyalty comparable to that which is founded upon the word and Covenant, and the Principle of Conſcience, bound by the Word and Oath of God. The late King adviſed thoſe who were deſirous to befriend him in his ſtraits, to preach the Obligation of the Covenant, which binds to maintain his Perſon and Authority.</p>
                  <p>The new Principles of Confuſion, which are oppoſite to the Magiſtrates Authority, and to the paying of Tribute to Rulers, are directly oppoſite to, and inconſiſtent with the Principles and Practices of <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> and ſeem to have been deviſed by <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and then craftily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into the heads of weak people, diſtmeper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſad ſuffering; or having Zeal without Knowledge, that they might at once render thoſe people ridiculous, and expoſe their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions as a prey, and their lives to the Sword and their profeſſion of Religion to contempt and
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:40126:302"/> ſcorn; as if it made men frantick, and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them of the uſe of common Reaſon and ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>I heard from a godly and learned Miniſter, That he heard a great Zealot againſt the paying of the Seſs, ſay, <hi>That whatever was unlawful for a man to do voluntarily, was unlawful for him to do upon Legal or Phyſical conſtraint;</hi> and another ſaid, <hi>If men on conſtraint might pay Seſs, which they ſhould not voluntarily do, without Legal and Phyſical conſtraint feared to follow; then the three Children might have worſhipped</hi> Nebuchadnezars <hi>Image, becauſe they were under conſtraint.</hi> And when it was anſwered, that there were ſome actions in the ſubſtance of the fact ſinful, that no conſtraint could make lawful, ſuch as Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and ſome, which outward Circumſtances made lawful or unlawful: that diſtinction was denied; ſuch is the ignorance of ſome of thoſe Teachers.</p>
                  <p>Another made the paying of the Seſs, like the offering of Children to <hi>Moloch.</hi> It's a great pity, that well-meaning people, who from a Principle of Conſcience, are willing rather to ſuffer, than to ſin, ſhould be miſguided by ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant men, and drawn into needleſs cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, to the ruin of their Families, and the reproach of Religion.</p>
                  <p>They add, <hi>That theſe Miniſters adviſed the Priſoners to take the Bond,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Thoſe Priſoners being taken at <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel-bridge,</hi> were preſſed to bind themſelves not to take up Arms againſt the Kings Perſon and
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:40126:302"/> Authority, under the Certification of no leſs pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment than Death.</p>
                  <p>Now as we heard from the larger Catechiſm, <hi>It's the duty of inferiors to defend and maintain the Perſons and Authority of their Superiors;</hi> which imports much more than the not taking up Arms againſt them and their Authority.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though they had not been Subjects, but only Priſoners of war in the victors power, to deprive them of life or liberty for ever; I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they could not have been blamed for the preſervation of their life, to have given in ſuch a Bond; ſome who were taken Priſoners by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> for their liberty engaged not to carry Arms againſt him; and I do not remember, that any cenſured them for it; what they ſay in a <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> that hazard will not make a moral change in actions, is a palpable error; if there were twenty with drawn-ſwords, waiting at the Church-door to kill a Miniſter, if he ſhould come to preach; it were raſh, furious, ſelf-deſtroying, ſelf-murdering Zeal for a Miniſter to venture to go to preach at that time, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite of the hazard, ſo certain, viſible, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable, and yet it were his duty at another time to preach, where there were no ſuch ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard; for a Merchant to caſt his Wares in the Sea in a calm, were wicked folly, contrary to the 8th. Command, a ſtealing from his Family and himſelf; and yet in a ſtorm, <hi>Paul</hi> and the Paſſengers and Mariners thought it their duty to caſt out both Goods and Tackling of the Ship.</p>
                  <pb n="612" facs="tcp:40126:303"/>
                  <p>This Subſcription would have no ways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned innocent ſelf-defence againſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt violence of Papiſts, which the Reformed Churches made uſe of, when they did caſt off the yoke of the Whore. <hi>David</hi> and his men had Arms, but they were not taken up againſt <hi>Sauls</hi> Perſon and Authority, as appears by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> practice, who would neither himſelf kill, nor ſuffer his men to kill <hi>Saul,</hi> and that upon the account of his Authority, being the Lords Anointed; and though <hi>Saul</hi> in his diſtemper, calls <hi>David</hi> his enemy; yet in his lucide inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, he calls him his Son.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the engaging not to take up Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Kings Perſon and Authority, and any lawful Oath of Allegiance, could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with ſuch Arms as the Contrivers of this Band, and Sanchar Declaration would be at; for their Arms are deſigned to deſtroy the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates perſon without mercy, and their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and the eſtabliſhed Civil Goverment which hath no parallel that I know of, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that of the <hi>Boors</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> under <hi>Thomas Munſter;</hi> and after, under <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden;</hi> which Uſurpation being not only of private perſons, but alſo being againſt the Magiſtrates perſon and Authority, was juſtly condemned, as a fury, by all the Reformed Churches.</p>
                  <p>At length after this long Inditement, they come to give ſentence againſt theſe Miniſters who have accepted of the peaceable exerciſe of their Miniſtry, and all who voted for that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, all who have heard and pleaded for
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:40126:303"/> them, trafficked for union with them; all that do not teſtifie againſt them, and deport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſuitably to their teſtimony; all who do not join publickly with the Brethren, who te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie againſt them. The ſentence is in effect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition as far as their power reaches; they ſay indeed that they have not, nor aſſume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves authoritative ſentences of depoſition and ſuſpenſion againſt theſe Miniſters; there is ſome modeſty here; yet they ſpecifie the cenſures, which ſhould be inflicted upon theſe Miniſters; no leſs will ſerve than depoſition or ſuſpenſion. It's ſomewhat ſtrange that they who had the confidence to depoſe the Magiſtrate as formally as they could, did not formally depoſe theſe Miniſters alſo; but though they do not formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depoſe them, yet they do it materially and effectually, in that they will neither hear them, nor receive Sacraments from them. And no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſeeing they had before declared them to be the Miniſters of men, &amp; not of Chriſt; the ground of this ſentence is a Scripture (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6.) but miſunderſtood, and ſo miſapplied; for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle is not there directing to withdraw from the Lords Ordinances, from the hearing of the Word, or Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, or from fellowſhip with the Church in the Worſhip of God; but he forbids ordinary, familiar, private converſe with diſorderly perſons, (it's a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor taken from Soldiers, who keep not their rank) idle, and yet buſie-bodies, buſie about that which did not belong to them, ſuch as are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.13. who were idle, wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:40126:304"/> about from houſe to houſe, tatlers, buſie-bodies, ſpeaking things which they ought not. The authors of this Band have made ſuch a breach upon all order, both in ſpeaking and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging to do things which they ought not, and which tend to all confuſion, that if they had underſtood this Scripture, and their own way, they would have ſeen their way condemned in this Scripture, from which they would condemn others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Orthodox Interpreters think that the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing which is enjoined in this Scripture, is to be after the Church hath taken due notice of the diſorder of ſuch perſons, and they after ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition continue diſobedient, ſee the <hi>Dutch</hi> Annotations, which cite <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. as parallel places; and <hi>Diodate,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dickſon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> upon the place.</p>
                  <p>If private perſons were left to Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate all whom they thought diſorderly, it would breed great confuſion; and if private perſons be not to be thus withdrawn from till the Church hath noted them, and proceeded by leſſer cenſures to the cenſure of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; How inſolent an act is this, for a few inconſiderable perſons, who, as they confeſs themſelves, have no capacity to inflict any cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to declare that they will carry themſelves towards ſo many miniſters, who have never been convened or heard, much leſs cenſured by any Church-Judicatory; and others who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to them, and all who teſtifie not againſt them, and do not publickly join with thoſe who
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:40126:304"/> teſtifie againſt them, as if they were depoſed and Excommunicate? and the inſolency was the greater, becauſe they knew that the miniſters who were not indulged, did think theſe young men who had not come to this height of Schiſm, cenſurable.</p>
                  <p>I am certainly informed, that this ſpirit of Schiſm hath prevailed ſo far in ſome, that they will not have private Chriſtian fellowſhip with any who hear Indulged miniſters; though they be perſons of ſo blameleſs and Chriſtian conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, that they have nothing to caſt at them for, but this, that they have clearneſs to hear Indulged miniſters. This joining in the Worſhip of God where theſe miniſters preach, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count a joining with the people of theſe abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, ignorantly perverting that place, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.14. as if joining in the commanded Worſhip of God, were like the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> joyning in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden marriages with the curſed Nations. <hi>But as the fool thinks, the bell clinks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The leaſt that they require of theſe depoſed and Excommunicate miniſters, is, that they ſtand in judgment before theſe miniſters, and be judged by them who have followed the Lord, and kept themſelves free of theſe defections. The leaſt I perceive that they will accept of, is no leſs than an acknowledging of Prelates, and ſetting up Prelacy.</p>

<pb n="616" facs="tcp:40126:305"/> will not deny what I ſay. Ye know your ſelf, that theſe Miniſters whom they mean, and who fall not in one of the Claſſes mentioned, were never for any thing known above four, and ſome ſay they were but three, and a little after this Band one of them was laid aſide from Preaching. And a Gentleman told me, that he was credibly informed, that he went hence to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and joined with the Conformiſts there. But ſuppoſe that they were four, yea fourteen, that would not make them the Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in a capacity to judg, to ſuſpend, or depoſe the Indulged, and not Indulged Miniſters of the Church of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and yet we ſee they have a juriſdiction over all the reſt of the Miniſters, who muſt ſtand before them, and be judged by them, and ſtand and fall in judgment, as theſe judges ſhall determine. And as they engroſs the power of ſuſpenſion and depoſition, ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the power of Ordination; and in their laſt Article they talk of a Goſpel-miniſtry, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly choſen, and rightly Ordained, and they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to rectifie what was amiſs in former Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.

                  <p>Doctor <hi>Gauden</hi> defines the Office of a Biſhop thus: <hi>Epiſcopal preſidency and authority, is a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign power, and Spiritual juriſdiction in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Confirmation, Cenſures, rebuking, ſilencing, Excommunication, Abſolution, and other exerciſes of Eccleſiaſtick power, without, above and againſt Presbyters and people.</hi>

                  <p>This deſcription, if ye will take Confirmation out of it, ſeems to agree much better to theſe new Prelates than to the old. They arrogate a Soveraign power, a power above all <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſters, who muſt ſtand before them when they ſet to judg them; and they muſt ſtand and fall as they are pleaſed to determine. Their Soveraignty is the more abſolute, that their Dignity proceeds of themſelves; and men uſe not to limit their own power when they have it, at their own making or taking; the old Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates depend upon the King, and they are ſent from Court. It's true, <hi>Athanaſius</hi>

Their new Prelates depend neither upon King nor <hi>Keſar,</hi> but are independent, their Prelacy proceeds of themſelves; this makes it very dreadful, like the Dominion of the <hi>Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Hab.</hi> 1.7. <hi>They are terrible and dreadful, their judgment and dignity ſhall proceed of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> They were terrible, becauſe as Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon</hi> upon the place ſaith, <hi>They would be their own carvers in all matters of advantage and honour, ſtanding to no law either of Nature, or Nations, in dealing with a terrified and ſubdued people, but meerly following their own will, armed with power.</hi>

I anſwer, if folk will be beguiled with names, the Pope will call himſelf <hi>Servus ſervorum,</hi> a Servant of Servants; but there is a real Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty given to them, when a Juriſdiction over all <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſters to ſuſpend, depoſe, and diſpoſe of their Miniſtry as they pleaſe, is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to them. And the other Prelates deal more candidly in taking the name of Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Lordſhip, ſeeing they have the thing.</p>
                  <p>Is it not a ſtrange arrogance that a Presbyter, or two or three Presbyters, ſhall claim a ſtated Juriſdiction over a great multitude of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who have the ſame office with themſelves? they either have that power over their Brethren by vertue of their Miniſterial Office, as they are Presbyters, or by vertue of ſome other Office: not by vertue of the Office of a Presbyter or Miniſter; for then one and the ſame Office ſhould make one Presbyter a Soveraign and Lord, and another Presbyter his ſubject; a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter as a Presbyter cannot have dominion over a Presbyter; for one and the ſame Office can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make a man Soveraign over another, who hath the ſame Office that he hath. If they have this Soveraign power over their Brethren by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of ſome other Office than the Office of a Miniſter or Presbyter, then let them tell us what Office this is, if it be not the Office of a Prelate.</p>

                  <p>The Apoſtles were extraordinary Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, had infallible inſtructions by their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and practice, did ſhew the Platform of the Church, were not limited to any fixed charge, and ſo might exerciſe their Miniſterial authority in all places where they came; they were to lay the foundations of Churches. But that they had any ſuch ſtated Juriſdiction over other Miniſters, as Prelates claim over Presbyters, is yet to be proven, for any thing I know; their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing Miniſters and Churches in their duty, and reproving their ſins, will not prove it, for the Prophets did ſo, and yet they had no ſtated Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction over the Prieſts. <hi>Paul</hi> reproved <hi>Peter,</hi> but had not juriſdiction over him.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Timothy</hi> or <hi>Titus</hi> had ſuch a ſtated Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over the Miniſters of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Creet,</hi> is yet to be proven; that they had the ſole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Ordination and Juriſdiction, and that the Miniſters of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Creet</hi> had no power of Ordination and Juriſdiction, is not yet proven.
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:40126:307"/> The Apoſtle directs them to Ordain, but that they are directed to do it alone, and not in conjunction with other Miniſters; is yet to be proven; <hi>Lay hands ſuddenly on no man,</hi> is a Direction applicable to every Miniſter; there are multitudes of Directions given them, that cannot be denied to be given to all Miniſters; and that ſome Directions are given to them, as Prelates, and ſome as Presbyters, is as eaſily denied as affirmed.</p>
                  <p>But though it were granted, that thoſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Officers in founding Churches at firſt, might do ſome things which ordinary Miniſters might not do; this would be no warrant for theſe two or three, who were but very ordinary perſons, to claim a Juriſdicton over the reſt. Whence have they their power? No man can receive any thing of this nature, except it be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him from Heaven, Joh. 3.27. Let us ſee their Patent, that we may know if it be leill come.</p>
                  <p>They muſt firſt ſhew a Warrant from the word for ſuch a Prelatical Sovereignty, and then let ut ſee how they came by it; no man ſhould take any Honour in the Church to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, at his own hand; he muſt be called of God, as was <hi>Aaron.</hi> If they ſay, That ſuch a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Juriſdiction is hot diſcharged, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's lawful. I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Offices and Officers of the Houſe of God, which are in the Scripture, are poſitively inſtituted and conſtituted of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>God hath ſet,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. <hi>God hath given,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8. If God hath not ſet theſe new Sovereign Judges, Miniſters ſhould not
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:40126:308"/> ſtand before them, as Judges; if God hath not given them for Sovereign Judges, we ſhould not receive them; and if they be not given, their Office is not a gift of Grace. It's a graceleſs thing, and we have nothing to do with it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It's not enough that an Office which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in the name of another, be not diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or forbidden, it muſt be charged and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; if a man ſhould claim to himſelf ſome new Office of Juſtice, or ſhould intrude him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into ſome Office which were ſetled by Law, would that be a ſufficient defence for him, that ſuch an Office was not diſcharged, nor he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to take ſuch an Office? it would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, He had no Law nor Command, or War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for what he did: it's not enough to make a man an Ambaſſador, that he is not diſcharged to go Ambaſſador, he muſt have a poſitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Lord in forbidding us to add to his word, hath diſcharged to add any Spiritual Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to thoſe which he hath inſtituted in the Word; and I ſee not how thoſe who take on them to make new Spiritual Offices in the Church, can hold out new Spiritual work for thoſe new Officers; and ſo we ſhall have new ſignificant Symbols and Sacraments, new worſhip; when they made the Office of the <hi>Pope,</hi> they out out new work for him, to make new Articles of Faith, to diſpence with the Laws of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or if they do not this, they take ſomewhat from the formerly eſtabliſhed Officers, and appropriate it to thoſe new ones; the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:40126:308"/> were firſt bereaved of the power of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and then of the power of Juriſdiction, <hi>ut aliquid faceret Epiſcopus, quod non faceret Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If they object, That the reſt of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters need not, except they pleaſe, ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to theſe Miniſters; and if they conſent to ſubject themſelves to them, and ſtand in Judgment before them, and ſubmit their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry to their diſpoſal, then they get this Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign power by the Miniſters voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and then <hi>volenti non fit injuria;</hi> may not Miniſters part with their power, and put it in the hand of one, or two, or three for unity and order? I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They do as much as they can to neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and force the Miniſters to ſubject themſelves to thoſe new Sovereign Judges; for as far as in them lyes, they effectually deſpiſe them; and in effect excommunicate them by withdrawing from them, until they ſtand in Judgment before their new Lords and Sovereigns, and come in their will.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It's a great and dangerous error to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that Miniſters of the Goſpel may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of their miniſterial power, as a man may diſpoſe of his money; and ſo may either quit all, or give part and retain the reſt; retain the power of preaching, and quit the power of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, in conjunction with others; for a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter hath not Dominion over his miniſterial Function, as a man hath over his money; but he is obliged to retain all that Authority that the
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:40126:309"/> Lord hath given him for edification, and to make full proof of his Miniſtry, as he will be anſwerable to his Maſter, who will require an account of the Talents he hath given him to occupy with; and therefore ſuppoſe the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> Miniſters were ſo demented, as to renounce their miniſterial Authority, in favour of their new Judges, this could not make their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Juriſdiction warrantable, becauſe this ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render made to them, would be a <hi>non habente poteſtatem;</hi> for Miniſters cannot give away their Authority to another, and therefore their new Judges would ſtill be Uſurpers, both in uſurping a Dominion which the Lord hath not given to Miniſters, and then taking it to themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any title.</p>
                  <p>The next thing in Dr. <hi>Gaudens</hi> Definition, is the exerciſe of this Sovereign power and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Juriſdiction in the ſeveral Acts, as Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Confirmation, Cenſures, Rebuking, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing, Excommunication, Abſolution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If we may conclude from the practice of theſe new Prelates, how Sovereign, high and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, they will be in their acts of power, we have ſome ground to think, they will out-do any Prelates that have been before them; for they have really, though not formally depoſed and excommunicated the Miniſters who differ from them, before any Proceſs, Tryal or hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted to theſe Miniſters; and one of them hath very ſummerly excommunicated the King, the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and ſeveral Peers and Officers of State. This is pretty
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:40126:309"/> high flown at the firſt flight, it's but now and then that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Pope himſelf, plays ſuch pranks as theſe. Ordinary Biſhops uſe to have formal proceſſes, and they allow Presbyters to have ſome ſhare in the trial, and leading of the proceſs againſt perſons to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, and they do not uſe to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate Kings and Princes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ambroſe</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Millain</hi> was ſomewhat ſingular in his cenſure of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, in keeping him ſeven months from enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the Church-doors. I grant, ſaith <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> in his Church-Hiſtory, this cenſure of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> is not approved of all; but there are none who can or ought to diſapprove the humility and repentance of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> who patiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the ſharp reproofs of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and did give example to the whole Church. But it's rare to find great ones of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> diſpoſition; there are conſiderable difficulties objected againſt the Excommunication of Supreme Magiſtrates. And the fault of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was ſo ſingular; for in his paſſion at a popular ſedition in <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> in which the Preſident and ſome Noblemen were killed, he ſent in Soldiers, who killed ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand perſons of all ages and ſexes, both guilty and innocent. And then the Emperour was a man ſo holy, humble and tender, and <hi>Ambroſe</hi> a Biſhop of ſo great authority, and ſo venerable and beloved, that if any ordinary Biſhop would attempt to imitate <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in this, he would readily find that he had miſtaken his meaſures, and would not find that he had to do with a
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:40126:310"/> 
                     <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> or that he himſelf were an <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> But as this is certain, that the Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Magiſtrates, Maſters and Parents, does not make void their Magiſtratical, Maſterly and Paternal authority; ſo this is granted, that as it is Church-Judicatories, and not ſingle perſons that ſhould Excommunicate; and<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rutherford</hi>'s Peaceable Plea, <hi>Pag.</hi> 5. ſaith, The Church, not one ſingle man, hath the power of Diſcipline; if one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor himſelf alone ſhould Excommunicate, the Excommunication were null both in the Court of Chriſt, &amp; his Church.</note> that theſe Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories muſt not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whether the fault deſerve Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but alſo whether they have authority over the perſon or perſons who are ſcandalous; and withal, as Mr. <hi>Durham</hi> upon the <hi>Commands</hi> ſaith, they would conſider when cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, by reaſon of ſome circumſtances, prove not edifying but hurtful to the Church and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons concerned. For, ſaith he, that which war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranteth debarring and cenſures of all ſorts, is edification; and when that end cannot be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a people or perſon, ſuch cenſures may be omitted.—Or upon the cenſure would proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly miſs its end, which is edification, and would weaken the authority of the Ordinance of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, if not hazard the liberty of the Goſpel; in that caſe he thinks that excluſion from the Sacrament by a ſentence, may be forborn.</p>
                  <p>But as for this late Excommunication, judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſober perſons are grieved and much aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to hear of it; and it's matter of ſport and deriſion to others; and it's more than probable
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:40126:310"/> that Jeſuits take advantage of the diſtempers of weak perſons, to drive them under pretext of zeal to ſuch Pope-like pranks, to make the Popes Excommunications of Princes leſs odious, and to render <hi>Presbyterians</hi> odious to Rulers; but any who will not ſhut their eyes, may ſee that ſuch extravagancies are inconſiſtent with <hi>Presbyterian</hi> principles and practices.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> adds, That this Soveraign Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is without, above, againſt Presbyters and people. In all theſe their new Prelates have the pre-eminency. For the firſt it is indeed true, that Prelates need not, if they pleaſe, deſire the preſence or advice of Presbyters, for they claim the ſole authority of Ordination and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, and the Presbyters have no concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in authoritative acts.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Author of the ſeaſonable caſe,</hi> ſpeaking of the Biſhops nomination of the Moderators of the Meetings of Exerciſe, has written, that the Biſhop did it with the Synod; this ſeemed to give the Synod a concurrence in the nomination of the Moderators, and therefore all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Copies which I ſaw were mended with a Pen, and the <hi>with</hi> was turned to <hi>in,</hi> which turned the Synods concurrence into a meer preſence.</p>

<pb n="628" facs="tcp:40126:311"/> nullus ſit qui juriſdictionem habet, praeter unum Epiſcopum, qui praeeſt. A Council is, wherein thoſe who are aſſembled have every one of them a part of the joint-power and juriſdiction belonging to that Council, as every Senator hath in the Senate. The comparing of the Act of</hi> Glaſgow, <hi>June</hi> 3. 1610, <hi>anent Viſitations, with the Act of Parliament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to it, ſheweth that Dioceſan Synods are Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Viſitations; the Biſhop ſummons to them in his own name, makes the Clerk appoint a Subſtitute or Vicegerent when he pleaſes; he only ſententiates, depoſes, ſuſpends; if he at any time number votes, and conclude according to the plurality, that is not done by vertue of the Act of</hi> Glaſgow, <hi>but by to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerance of the Biſhop; who does it to ſettle himſelf in poſſeſſion. But when they pleaſe they will not ſo much as ſuffer a matter to come to voicing and therefore they who cannot come to a Biſhops parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Viſitation, when he or his Subſtitute viſits the Kirks of his Dioceſs ſeverally, which was wont to be called</hi> Viſitatio plena, <hi>he cannot go to the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan Synod, which is nothing but a ſuperficial ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled Viſitation, deviſed to hold in the Biſhops tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel in going through the Dioceſs to make a full Viſitation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But ſuppoſe they were Councils, yet they are not fre, for the Biſhop by his negative, whether in the Synod, or out of the Synod, even in a Court infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the Synod, may daſh all done in the Synod; yea he may do it by his Affirmatives in the very Synod, ſo that the Presbyters are only in the nature of Counſellors.</hi> Thus far he.</p>
                  <pb n="629" facs="tcp:40126:311"/>
                  <p>From which we ſee the Biſhop claims the ſole authority, and he might act without Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters if he pleaſed; yet they uſe not to act without their Presbyters; and uſe to ſeek their advice and counſel; but their new Prelates do not deſire the advice or preſence of Presbyters; the old Prelates are ſo diſcreet, that they ſuffer the Presbyters to ſit beſide them as Counſellors, but theſe new ones do neither admit them to ſit or ſtand as Counſellors, but require them to ſtand as guilty to be judged. And ſo Dr. <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>'s definition is more verified in them than in the former Biſhops.</p>
                  <p>As for the next Clauſe in the Doctors deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz.</hi> above Presbyters, it agrees alſo to their new Prelates; and their ſuperiority over Presbyters, is the more intollerable, that there is no kind of pretext for it, for they are deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only Miniſters; now a Miniſter as a Miniſter to be above Miniſters, is an uſurpation the more intollerable that it is not colourable with any pretext, either Divine or humane. The old Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates plead a ſuperiority <hi>Jure Regio,</hi> which King <hi>James</hi> they ſay thought their ſureſt title, and that they had beſt to hold them by <hi>Jure Jacobi.</hi> Some plead from Analogy, that as the high Prieſt was over the Prieſts, ſo the Biſhop may be over the Presbyters. But to let paſs the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of the Typicalneſs of the Office of the high Prieſt, I have not yet ſeen any argument to prove that the high Prieſt had a Soveraign Juriſdiction over the reſt of the Prieſts; he might do ſeveral things which the reſt of the Prieſts
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:40126:312"/> might not do, as ſome ſervants have more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſervice in a family, and yet no maſterly or Soveraign power over other ſervants, who have not ſo eminent ſervice allotted to them. They have a pretext alſo from the <hi>Aſian</hi> Angels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there one Angel in the ſingular number is written to; it's true, that reaſon taken from the ſingular number, to prove that it muſt needs be a ſingle perſon, is no ſolid argument, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in a myſtical Book, ſuch as the <hi>Revelation</hi> is, in which ſometimes one is ſpoken of in the Plural number, as in the firſt Chapter, the one Spirit of God is called ſeven Spirits. The four Beaſts, the four and twenty Elders, are not four individual perſons, or four and twenty ſingle Elders. The ſeven Angels, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.2, 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.1. are not to be reſtricted to ſeven individual An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. The Woman clothed with the Sun, the Whore, the Beaſt, the Dragon, are names of the ſingular number, and yet ſignifie a collection of many Individuals. When the Angel of the Lord is ſaid to incamp about them who fear the Lord, it's expounded of Angels, becauſe one Angel cannot be properly ſaid to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp.</p>
                  <p>Again, they have a pretext of Superiority, as Biſhops over Presbyters. It's true, <hi>Presbyterians</hi> make it evident from Scipture, that Biſhop and Presbyter are one there. And Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> to evite the dint of this argument, was forced to alledg, That all the Presbyters mentioned in the Scripture, were Biſhops and not Miniſters; for he ſaw that he behoved either to loſe the
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:40126:312" rendition="simple:additions"/> Biſhop or the Presbyter in the Bible; for not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are Presbyters called Biſhops, but they are made Biſhops by the Holy Ghoſt; now to ſay that the Holy Ghoſt made them nominally Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, but not really Biſhops, is very injurious to the work of the Spirit, as if it were produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive only of an empty name. And it takes away the force of the argument, <hi>Feed the flock of God over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers,</hi> or Biſhops. If they had only the name of Biſhops, and not the Office, the argument would not be cogent; for a meer empty name and title, doth not oblige a man who gets it, to any work. And as <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>That the Holy Ghoſt made the Elders of the Church of Epheſus Biſhops:</hi> So the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts Elders to take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection to do the work of Biſhops, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Neither doth the name of Biſhop import any primacy of one Miniſter over others; for the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> taketh the love of pre-eminence or primacy in <hi>Diotrephes;</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi> commends the deſire of the Office of a Biſhop, which ſhews that the Office of a Biſhop doth not import a primacy.</p>
                  <p>But though Biſhop and Presbyter be one in the Scripture, yet it cannot be denied, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward the name of Biſhop began to be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to ſome Miniſters in eminent Cities, and afterward Ordination, and then Juriſdiction, was by degrees taken from the Presbyters. It's true, <hi>Presbyterians</hi> when they are urged with theſe humane ſtories, and with the holineſs of the Ancients, who were Biſhops; they do not
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:40126:313"/> deny, but praiſe the holineſs and zeal of theſe Ancients, who were Biſhops; but neither the holineſs of the men, nor the Eccleſiaſtick cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom will prove the Divine right of the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy pleaded for. If any would plead for Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy from the holineſs of <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the Faithful, and of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who as a Prince did prevail with God in weeping, and making ſupplication; Or from the long continuance of that Polygamy; the anſwer were eaſie, <hi>From the beginning it was not ſo;</hi> God made male and female. So when they plead that Biſhop and Presbyter were diſtinguiſhed in after-times, it's anſwered, <hi>From the beginning it was not ſo,</hi> God made Biſhop and Presbyter one; man ſhould not have made them two, nor made the one leſs to make the other greater than he was by Divine conſtitution. Yet it cannot be denied that this is a very plauſible pretext, for ſetting up Biſhops above Presbyters. But their new Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates have no pretext, nor colour imaginable for their Juriſdiction over Presbyters; for they pretend to no other name but Miniſters, and yet they will Lord it over their fellow Miniſters; and thus their Soveraignty is more intollerable, becauſe it hath no kind of colour or pretext for it.</p>
                  <p>The laſt clauſe in the Doctors Definition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Presbyters,</hi> is pretty ingenious; for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates engroſs the power that <hi>Presbyters</hi> ſhould have; Prelacy riſes upon the ruines of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; yet I ſuppoſe the generality of thoſe who are for Epiſcopacy, will give the Doctor no
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:40126:313"/> thanks for that clauſe of the Definition; but it agrees very well with their new Prelates; for at their firſt appearance in the world, they ſtand in a poſture of oppoſition againſt the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of the Church of <hi>Scotland;</hi> they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel them, they effectually depoſe them, if not excommunicate them; nor can they expect to be abſolved, till they make theſe their Accuſers their Judges, and ſtand in Judgment to be judged by them; and if we may gueſs by the Libel which the Judges themſelves formed, the ſentence would not be very comfortable.</p>
                  <p>There is yet another thing which would make them a very dangerous ſort of Prelates, and that is, That they not only engroſs this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign and Peerleſs power over <hi>Presbyters,</hi> but alſo (which other Prelates uſe not to do) they engroſs a ſingularity in Holineſs, as if they, and they alone, had followed God, and were free of Defections, which other Miniſters are involved in; and it's like, this is one of the Foundations of their new Sovereignty, that they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, though the leſſer, yet the ſounder part of the miniſtry. It puts me in mind of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman, who underſtood not Latine, who heard ſome talking great things that the <hi>ſenior pars Eccleſiae</hi> could do; he enquired what is he, that <hi>Sanior?</hi> he ſems to be ſome great man? but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be Judges themſelves, they will not be accounted by men of ſound minds, to be the ſounder part of the Church; Nay, <hi>Oreſtes</hi> himſelf would ſay it, and ſwear it, That the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of this Bond was not the work of a man ſound in his mind.</p>

                     <pb n="634" facs="tcp:40126:314"/>Non ſani eſſe homines non ſanus juret Oreſtes.</q>
                  <p>Any may ſee with half an eye, that this is not a Presbyterial form of Government; for in Presbytery, the Plurality carries matters, and the part is ruled by the whole; but here the part, and a very little conſiderable part, and a part not in conjunction with the whole, but that hath disjoyned it ſelf from the whole, takes upon it to govern the whole, even as if a little Toe ſhould disjoyn it ſelf from the Body, and then take upon it to judge the whole Body, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of it at its pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>It is a wonder, that ſo few men, ſo inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable for number and parts, were not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to think of their ſitting and judging ſo many Miniſters; let be to publiſh it to the world. As their high Court of Juſtice would have made ſtrange havock of Magiſtrates, and readily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched ſome Presbyterian Miniſter for Loyalty, as Mr. <hi>Love</hi> was diſpatched in <hi>England</hi> to be a terrour to others; ſo this Eccleſiaſtick Judicatory in all appearance, if Miniſters had been ſuch fools as to have owned them, would have made great havock of Miniſters; for a few weak men, not ſound in their Principles, and tranſported with Paſſion and Impatience, and poſſeſt with a Conceit of their ſingular Purity and Zeal, and uſurping a pre-eminency over the generality of Miniſters, and taking on them to be their Judges, and talking of no leſs than depoſition, before they were in any capacity to depoſe, would have made a very Kittle-Court.</p>
                  <pb n="635" facs="tcp:40126:314" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>It's a ſad ſpectacle to behold many through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and blinding humours, running into the ſame evils which they in words diſclaim. They in words diſclaim Independency, and yet really make the people and not Church-Officers to be Rulers and guides to direct Miniſters what to preach and do, and to depoſe them if they obey not theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. They who called themſelves the Council of the Army which was broken at <hi>Bothwel-Bridge,</hi> were highly diſpleaſed with the indulged Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, becauſe the ſecret Council had ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to them, though the indulged Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters did not accept of them; and yet theſe ſame perſons took upon them to preſcribe to thoſe Miniſters and Preachers that were with them, what Doctrine they ſhould preach; which was an encroachment beyond any thing done by the ſecret Council.</p>
                  <p>Some talk of Presbytery and Presbyterian parity, and of their deteſtation of Prelacy; and in the mean time, ſet up Prelacy; it's a great evidence of a Spirit of giddineſs, when people run round, as thoſe who run in a Circle, and ſo run to that point from which they once did run.</p>
                  <p>The Declaration at <hi>Sanquair</hi> is refuted in the Confutation of the Bonds; and the truth is, ſuch principles and practices are ſo abſurd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to all Rule and Government, that they are not worthy of Refutation, and ſhould be anſwered with deteſtation and abhorrence.

<pb n="636" facs="tcp:40126:315"/> thoſe that are againſt them, as they have done to them; if they had conſidered <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.22. <hi>Say not thou, I will recompence evil; but wait on the Lord, and he ſhall ſave thee;</hi> and <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.29. <hi>Say not, I will do ſo to him, as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.</hi> Rom. 12.14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 1 Theſ. 5.15. 1 Pet. 3.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. They might have ſeen how groundleſs and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd this hope was. The 8 and 9 veſes of the 137 <hi>Pſalm</hi> are wreſted, when applied to juſtifie ſuch unchriſtian Practices; for that Scripture is a prediction of the proſperous ſucceſs that the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> ſhould have in deſtroying <hi>Babylon;</hi> which is alſo foretold, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.1, 3, 4, 13. and not a Rule to warrand us to revenge our ſelves, and to daſh out the brains of Infants. It's among the deluſions of the time, that ſome know not of what Spirit they are, and imagine that to be the Zeal of God, which is nothing but the wrath of man, which worketh not the Righteouſneſs of God.</p>
                  <p>It is meet to ſhut up this ſad Subject with humble and earneſt Supplications, That the Lord would humble us in the ſight and ſenſe of our ſins, which have procured the dreadful Judgments and Plagues which have come upon this ſinful Generation; That he would convince us of our ſins, and make every one ſenſible of the Plagues of his own heart, and of the Plagues that are upon the hearts of others, which are among the moſt dreadful evidences of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God, that Magiſtrates, Miniſters, people
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:40126:315"/> of all ranks, may take with their ſins, and take ſhame and confuſion of face to themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their own ſins, and the ſins of others.</p>
                  <p>That he would ſo turn in mercy and loving-kindneſs, and turn us again, that our backſlidings be not perpetual; and turn the hearts of Rulers and the hearts of people to himſelf; and the hearts of Rulers to the people, and the hearts of people to the Rulers; the hearts of the fathers to the children, and of the children to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; that Rulers may have the love, kindneſs, pity and compaſſion of fathers towards the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and may not by rigor and ſeverity provoke the children to wrath, and may pity thoſe who are diſtempered by ſad ſufferings; and that the Lord would incline their hearts to take ſpeedy courſe that the poor people who wander as ſheep without ſhepherds, and who through their own ignorance, and humours, and diſtempers, are expoſed as a prey to ſeducers, to Jeſuits, and thoſe who are influenced by them, who drive poor unſtable people (who are deſtitute of faithful Teachers to diſcover to them the devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Satan, and of his Inſtruments) into ſnares and miſchievous practices, and makes them ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that thoſe pathes of the deſtroyer are the way to an outgate from their calamities. That the Lord would incline, I ſay, their hearts to take ſpeedy courſe that theſe poor wandering ſheep may be provided with Paſtors after the Lords heart, who may feed them with knowledg and underſtanding, with ſound doctrine, with the wholeſome words of Chriſt, that they may not
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:40126:316"/> be turned from the truth unto fables, but by the words of the Lords mouth they may be keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the paths of the deſtroyer, and any who are intangled through the devices of Satan, and ſubtil deceivers, may be recovered in time out of theſe ſnares. And that the Lord would incline the hearts of people to be ſubject to prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and powers, and to obey Magiſtrates, to fear God, and honour the King, and keep them that they be not tempted by grievous preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to caſt off the yoke of lawful Authority, but may poſſeſs their ſouls in patience; and wait on the Lord in the way of his judgments, who often makes uſe of lawful Magiſtrates to pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh his people for their ſins; and though the Magiſtrate may be wrong, yet God is righteous, and we ſhould be humbled under his hand. It's a very humbling diſpenſation, when Parents and Magiſtrates are alienate from, and rigid againſt their children and ſubjects; and we ſhould not be chafed and enraged, but humbled under the mighty hand of God; and carry with that low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and meekneſs, patience and reſpect to law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority, that we may commend ourſelves to the conſciences of all in the ſight of God, that being reviled, we may bleſs; being perſecuted, we may ſuffer it; being defamed, we may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.</p>

It's ſad to ſee ſeveral people who will talk great things of the intereſts of Chriſt in the Land, ſo ignorant of Chriſt, and of union with him, and ſo unconcerned as to their own intereſt in Chriſt, that though they have no aſſurance of it, and cannot give one mark of intereſt in Chriſt; yet they are not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of this, nor regrating it, nor earneſtly ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in publick or private to know him, to be in him, to know if they be in him, but they are taken up with other things. Chriſt is not in their mind, heart, and mouth; they are not ſpeering after him in their private converſe, as the Spouſe doth in the Song: <hi>Saw ye him whom my ſoul loveth?</hi> They are more in ſeeking to know ſome uſeleſs barren notion, ſome jangling de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, than they are in ſeeking to know Chriſt and him crucified; more taken up in apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome unedifying empty conceit, than in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending Chriſt, or ſeeking to be apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him.

Be much in the exerciſe of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; ye muſt live and walk by Faith, and be daily ſearching out your ſins, looking into the ſink of original corruption, that loathſome, ſtinking, corrupt body of Death that is ever preſent with you, to hinder you from good, and incline you to evil; and to the innumerable ſwarms of actual ſins, which compaſs you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; and ye muſt be daily confeſſing your ſins, judging your ſelf, lamenting after the Lord, lying at the Fountain opened to the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the great High Prieſt Jeſus the Son of God, to the Throne of Grace, to obtain Mercy and find Grace to help in the time of need. Theſe exerciſes would hold you doing, and keep you from medling, as a buſie-body, in things too high for you, and that do not belong to you; and are not within the compaſs of your calling: if ye were thus exerciſed, ye would walk humbly with God, and humbly with men; ye would be ſo far from bidding others ſtand by themſelves, as if ye were holier than they, that in holineſs of mind ye would eſteem others better than your ſelves; and ſo far from caſting at fellowſhip with the Lords people in publick

Chriſt himſelf preached, that men ſhould repent and believe the Goſpel; and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> taught Repentance toward God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Repentance and Faith are as neceſſary for the beginning and progreſs of our motion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, as our two legs are neceſſary for walking; and the exerciſe of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance ceaſe not, till all tears be wiped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and Faith be turned into ſight; to cut off the exerciſe of Faith and Repentance, is to cut off the legs of a man, who is fleeing from ſin and wrath to the true City of Refuge. Ye may be ſure, that thoſe Teachers who make it their buſineſs to diſcover to you your ſins and diſeaſes, your poverty, nakedneſs, filthineſs, and direct you to Chriſt, as the Saviour of ſinners, as the Phyſitian of ſouls, as full of grace and truth, who hath fine white Raiment, fine Gold, who is a fountain opened, who teach you to

Let the Glory of God, and the enjoying of God, be your chief end, and take his word, which is contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament, for the only Rule to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you how to glorifie and enjoy him; deny your ſelf, beware of ſelf-ſeeking, ſelf-pleaſing, of pleaſing your own humors or the humors of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

               <p>The Devil can back his ſuggeſtions with Scriptures, which he perverts, as we ſee he did, when he tempted Chriſt to caſt himſelf down from the Pinacle of the Temple; and therefore there is the more need to ſearch the Scripture, and to compare Scripture with Scripture, and to
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:40126:320"/> conſider what goeth before, and what followeth in the Scripture; and to know the Analogy of Faith from the Scriptures that are more clear; and as it is holden forth from the Scriptures in the Confeſſion of Faith and Catechiſms, that ye may not receive any ſenſe of Scripture which is contrary to the Analogy of Faith, to the Doctrine which is according to godlineſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Reformed Churches. Beware of adding to the word of God, by making theſe things Duties, which God hath not commanded; or making any thing ſinful, which God hath not forbidden; there are too many who will confidently impoſe their Conceits upon others, and too many who are eaſily impoſed upon; ſimple people who believe every word, and are toſſed to and fro with every wind. Study to be well founded in the Scriptures, that with the <hi>Bereans</hi> ye may try Doctrines and Practices by the Rule of the holy Scripture. It's lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that there is ſo great ignorance of the Scriptuees; and many are more in reading other writings than in reading the holy Scriptures. Walk exactly according to the light which the Lord hath given to you from his word, detain it not in unrighteouſneſs, and beware ye go no further than the light of the word directs you; for if ye go out of the light, and be in the dark, ye know not how far ye may wander; they who without direction from the word, do blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow the example of others, and know not whether it be right or wrong, or take what others do to be right, becauſe ſuch or ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:40126:321"/> does it, they are in an ill taking. Beware ye go not without the word, walk in the Law of the Lord, in the light of the word, which is a light to the feet, and a Lamp to the paths.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And that ye may be nouriſhed up in the knowledge of the Scriptures of truth; go to the publick Ordinances, forſake not aſſembling together with the Lords people, who meet in his name; the Lord hath commanded his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to teach and baptize, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be with them to the end of the world, and hath promiſed, That where he records his Name, there he will come and bleſs his people; he hath appointed Miniſters for this end, to feed his people with the knowledge and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word, with the ſincere Milk of the word; and therefore if ye would glorifie the Name of the Lord, if ye would have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God, if you would have his preſence and his Bleſſing, if ye would know his mind and will revealed in his word, frequent his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, beware of thoſe who would draw you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the Shepherds Tents, for they draw you away from Chriſt himſelf; for it's there that he feeds and makes his Flocks to reſt. Believe not thoſe who ſay, That he is not to be found in his own Ordinances; for there he is, and hath tryſted his people to meet him there; and he hath promiſed to come there and bleſs them, whenever they are met in his name. He is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, he is not to come, when they are met in his Name; for he is come already; <hi>There am I,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in the midſt of them.</hi> The ſins of thoſe
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:40126:321"/> who are preſent at the Lords Ordinances ſhall not deprive thoſe who, upon his call, comes to record his Name of his Preſence and bleſſing; for he is faithful who hath promiſed; and they who come according to his appointment, to glorifie his Name in his own Ordinances, may be aſſured, that he comes and bleſſes them, though it may be, they do not ſenſibly diſcern it; and they are bound to believe it, that he hath come and bleſſed them, becauſe he hath ſaid it.</p>
               <p>Beware of thoſe who think they are the beſt and moſt tender Chriſtians, who are readieſt to caſt Miniſters as no Miniſters, and Churches as no Churches; there were many great faults in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> in ſeveral of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and their Angels; and yet Chriſt himſelf owns them and their Angels, as Chuches, and Angels; and we find not that the Lord di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects any to ſeparate from theſe Churches, or their Aſſemblies for publick worſhip, becauſe of thoſe ſcandalous ſins, which were among them. We find, Chriſt himſelf preſent in the Church of <hi>Lacdicea,</hi> which was the worſt of them, and ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at their door and knocking. It's inſolent boldneſs to caſt theſe as no Churches and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, whom Chriſt owns; or who condemn going to theſe Meetings where Chriſt himſelf comes and bleſſes his people; remember that your great buſines in Ordinances, is with the Lord himſelf; for they are his Ordinances he hath appointed them; the efficacy of them, depends upon his Inſtitution and Bleſſing, and not upon
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:40126:322"/> the worthineſs and intention of Miniſters; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever abſent themſelves, ye may be ſure he is preſent whom your ſoul ſhould ſeek; come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he calls you, and becauſe he comes and bleſſes his people, where he cauſes his Name to be recorded. Learn to hear the Word, not as the word of man, but as the word of God. Eſteem the Miniſters of Chriſt very highly in love for their works-ſake, and for their Maſters ſake. Beware of the way of thoſe who caſt at the Ordinances if they be not diſpenſed by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the moſt eminent gifts, or by Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters who are in all things of their opinion; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Lords meſſage of the hand of any of his Meſſengers. Beware of idolizing any Miniſter; Remember that neither he that planteth, nor he that watereth, is any thing, but God who giveth the encreaſe; And beware of undervaluing any of the Lords Miniſters, ſeeing they are the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. In which Chapter the Apoſtle diſſwades the <hi>Corinthians</hi> who over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued ſome, and undervalued others of their Miniſters, from this comparing and raſh judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Miniſters; and among other Arguments uſes this, <hi>That they judge before the time;</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires them to let alone that judging till the Lord come, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. who knew the counſels of the heart, and the hidden things of darkneſs.</p>
               <p>Neglect not the private exerciſes of Religion upon the Lords day, but beware of the way of thoſe who neglect the publick Ordinances, though they have the opportunity of them; theſe private Meetings which were kept in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>

               <p>Beware of waſting your time in ſpeaking ill of abſent perſons; remember the words, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. <hi>To ſpeak evil of no man, &amp;c.</hi> Make not that your

Beware of raſh determinations of queſtions which ye underſtand not; ſome people are ſo raſh, that no queſtion is ſtarted but they will preſently determine it; and having vented their judgment, they will not readily retract. Meddle not as a buſie-body in other mens matters, and in things too high for you, which are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſs of your calling. Waſte not your precious time, as many people do, in State-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues; It belongs to the Repreſentatives of Nations, and not to private perſons, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine matters of that nature. What the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of Nations may do for righting what is wrong in the Government of Nations, is a queſtion which the Repreſentatives of Nations, and not private perſons ſhould move and reſolve. It's a trick of Satan and ſeditious Jeſuits to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert people from the duties of their Chriſtian and particular callings, and to break and crack their brains in over-ſtretching them to reach things that are above them, and to graſp mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which they can never comprehend; and though they could underſtand them, have no call to meddle with them. And if private perſons take the ſword which God hath not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them, to right what they think wrong, by ſtrong hand; And if private perſons take upon them to depoſe Miniſters for real or apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:40126:323"/> faults, this is the high-way to all confuſion, to turn State and Church upſide down, and to fill the world with murthers and butcheries, to turn it into a Butcher-houſe, and to fill the Church with ſchiſm, and damnable errors. Theſe are the methods of the lying and murthering ſpirit, to make havock of the ſouls and bodies of men.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Imitate the example of our Lord Jeſus, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Be followers of God as dear children, and walk in love as Chriſt alſo hath loved us. Let all bitterneſs and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil ſpeaking, be put away from you, with all malice; and be ye kind one to another, tender hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, forgiving one another, even as God for Chriſts ſake hath forgiven you. Put on therefore as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindneſs, humbleneſs of mind, meekneſs, long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another. If any man have a quarrel againſt any, even as Chriſt forgave you, ſo alſo do ye. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectneſs. Love them that hate you. Bleſs and curſe not. Be not overcome with evil, but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come evil with good.</hi> Learn of Chriſt to be meek and lowly in heart, ſhew all meekneſs to all men. <hi>The ornament of a meek and quiet ſpirit is of great price in the ſight of God.</hi> When ye are injured and perſecuted, learn of Chriſt to be patient, and in your patience poſſeſs your ſouls. Look above men who wrong you, unto God, who is correcting or trying you, and be humbled, and patient under the mighty hand of God, fret not at the proſperity of thoſe who for a while
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:40126:324"/> bring evil devices to paſs, but truſt in the Lord, and be doing good. And delight thy ſelf in the Lord: Commit your way to him: Wait on the Lord, and in well-doing commit your ſelf to him as to a faithful Creator. Take heed to your ſpirit, beware that ye be not deluded by Satan, and brought to imagine, that wrathful revenge is zeal. <hi>Who is a wiſe man, and endued with knowledg among you? let him ſhew out of a good converſation his works with meekneſs of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; hut if ye have bitter envying and ſtrife in your hearts, glory not, and be not againſt the truth. This wiſdom deſcendeth not from above, but is earthly, ſenſual, deviliſh; for where envying and ſtrife is, there is confuſion and every evil work. But the wiſdom that is from above, is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle and eaſie to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hypocriſie. And the fruit of righteouſneſs is ſown in peace of them that make peace.</hi> The Spirit of Chriſt oppoſeth that ſpirit which luſteth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and revenge. When <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> would have been at fire from Heaven to conſume the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> Chriſt turned and rebuked them, and ſaid, <hi>Ye know not what manner of ſpirit ye are of, for the Son of man is not come to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them.</hi> Let that be your conſtant deſign and endeavour to expreſs the praiſes, the vertues of Chriſt in reſembling him in lovelineſs, in love, in bowels and mercies, in humility, lowlineſs of heart, in ſelf-denial, in gentleneſs, meekneſs, patience, long-ſuffering, forbearance, forgiveneſs; that the ſame mind may be in you that was in Chriſt Jeſus; that ye
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:40126:324"/> may be in the world as he was in the world; that ye may walk in his ſteps; that ye may be conformed to the Image of the Son of God, and Chriſt formed in you. He countenanced the Ordinances, he heard <hi>John,</hi> was baptized of him, when the people were baptized; he was Circumciſed, he Prayed, Preached, and eated the Paſſover, when <hi>Judas</hi> the Traytor was preſent; he directed the Lepers whom he cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſhew themſelves to the Prieſt; he was ſubject to <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his Mother; he payed tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and directed others to do ſo.</p>
               <p>It adorns the Doctrine of God, when thoſe who profeſs it, are dutiful in their ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Stations; when they join Righteouſneſs with Religion, when they fear God and honour the King, when they are ſubject to Magiſtrates out of a principle of Conſcience, when they are obedient Children, faithful ſervants, doing their work heartily, as to the Lord. And when it is other ways, the name of God is blaſphemed, and the way of God is evil ſpoken of.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Beware of the firſt beginnings of ſinful courſes, beware left any root of bitterneſs ſpring up; if ye give way to the firſt motions of evil, they will encreaſe to more ungodlineſs; if the deſire after the ſincere milk of the word begin to languiſh, if ye look not to it in time, ye may come to an indifferency, whether you hear the word or not, and that may increaſe to a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and lightlying of the word, and that may increaſe to a contempt of the Preaching of the word, and then God in his righteous judgment may leave you to be plagued with Papers and
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:40126:325"/> Pamphlets, and Teachers after your own luſts, which will foſter you in the contempt of the Ordinances; and make you imagine, that it's tenderneſs and zeal, and a teſtimony, to deſpiſe the Lords Ordinances; and ſo far delude you as to make you imagine that profanity is Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If you let that honour and reſpect which by the command of God is due to Magiſtrates decay, you may come next to deſpiſe them, and curſe them in your heart and thought, and then mutter out theſe revilings in private, and then vent them openly, and from virulent words come to open violence, to deſign and endeavour to turn them out of their places, and murther them, and then be plagued with Papers and Doctrines, deluding you to that height as to bring you to think that this fury is the zeal of God. If ye loſe the eſteem, and love that ye ſhould have to the Miniſters of Chriſt, ye may come by degrees to deſpiſe them, and revile them, and to think it good ſervice to God to make their Miniſtry uſeleſs and contemptible; yea, ye may come to that, to think it good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to God to kill his ſervants; and in the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous judgment of God, you may be left to the deluſions of Satan, to imagine that theſe abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations make you holier than others; tremble at the deceitfulneſs of the deſperately wicked heart of man, and at the dreadful but holy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, who gives over the backſlider in heart to be filled with his own ways, and plagues thoſe who receive not the truth in love; and who harbours and entertains luſts contrary to the word of God with ſtrong deluſions, and

               <p n="9">9. And becauſe no ſpeaking nor reaſoning will prevail againſt the working of a ſpirit of error and ſchiſm, without the effectual working of the
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:40126:327"/> pirit of the Lord, let us humbly and earneſtly pray, that the Lord would have mercy upon us, &amp; for his Sons ſake who came to deſtroy the works of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, pour upon us the ſpirit of grace and of ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, the ſpirit of faith &amp; repentance, that we may look on him whom we have pierced, &amp; mourn; the ſpirit of a ſound mind, the ſpirit of love &amp; peace. And that every one, Magiſtrates, Miniſters and people, may be made ſenſible of their own ſins. We ſhould pray that the Lord would ſend his Spirit, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces the world of ſin, to let us ſee our ſins, and to let us ſee them written in our judgments, that we may accept of the puniſhment of our ſins, &amp; juſtifie the Lord when he judges. The Lord often writes the ſins of men in ſo great and legible letters in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they who run may read them. <hi>David</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed the Lord, and occaſioned the enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme, by his adultery and murther; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous filthineſs breaks out in his houſe, the ſword departs not from his houſe, his people deſpiſe him, and follow <hi>Abſalom. Shimei,</hi> an exaſperate <hi>Benjamite,</hi> is let looſe upon him, to revile and curſe him, and caſt ſtones at him; he diſowns him as no King, gives him no title of honour, but only calls him a man, and which was worſe, a bloody man, a man of <hi>Belial:</hi> and does not cry, and then flee; but goes along in the ſight and hearing of the King, Courtiers, and Soldiers, curſing &amp; caſting ſtones and duſt. <hi>David</hi> ſees, that tho' <hi>Shimei</hi> did this contrary to the Law of God, which ſays, <hi>Thou ſhalt not revile the Gods, nor curſe the ruler of thy people;</hi> Yet that he did it not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the over-ruling Providence of God; he ſaw that the Lord had let <hi>Shimei</hi> looſe upon him, &amp; is humbled under the hand of God. <hi>Uzziah</hi> will needs go to the
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:40126:328"/> Temple, &amp; exerciſe the Prieſts Office, &amp; the Lord by Leproſie cuts him off from the Houſe of the Lord, and from the exerciſe of his Kingly Office. When the Prieſts did not impartially apply the Law of God to reclaim the people from their ſins, no doubt they thought thus to keep in with the people; but this brought them to be baſe &amp; contemptible before all the people, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.9. The <hi>Jews</hi> that remained in the land, after the ruin of the Temple, though they had but one Prophet, yet they deſpiſe him, they will not hear the word which <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpoke in the name of the Lord, but they would do what went out of their own mouth; and therefore the Lord leaves them to live like Pagans, &amp; ſwears by his great name, that his name ſhould not be named any more in their mouths; they ſhould not have ſo much as the form &amp; profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the worſhip of the true God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.16, 26. they would not be reproved by <hi>Ezek. ch.</hi> 3.26. &amp; they are plagued with the want of a reprover. When peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will reject the counſel of the Lord, &amp; will not hearken to his voice, nor take his gracious offer made in the Goſpel; when they will not endure ſound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, nor deſire the ſincere milk of the word, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the truth in love, the Lord juſtly gives them up to their own hearts luſts, to walk in their own counſels, to ſtrong deluſions, to believe lyes, to be toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to and fro with every wind of Doctrine, to turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide to fables. When they deſpiſe his ſervants, &amp; will not receive his m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſſengers, &amp; their meſſage, &amp; count them enemies for telling the truth, the Lord removes his ſervants from them, &amp; leaves them to be deluded with teachers, which are after their own humours and luſts. When people refuſe to hear the Lords words, and walk after the imaginations of their
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:40126:328"/> own heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.10. the Lord fills them with drunkenneſs, that they deſtroy one another like drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken men, who know not what they are doing, <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Behold, I will fill all the Inhabitants of this Land, even the Kings that ſit upon</hi> Davids <hi>Throne, and the Prieſts, and the Prophets, and all the Inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>with drunkenneſs. And I will daſh them one againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, even the Fathers and the Sons together, ſaith the Lord: I will not pity, nor ſpare, nor have mercy, but deſtroy them. Hear ye, and give car; be not proud, for the Lord hath ſpoken. Give glory to the Lord your God before he cauſe darkneſs, and before your feet ſtumble upon the dark mountains, and while ye look for light, he turn it into the ſhadow of death, and make it groſs darkneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When folk will follow their own imaginations, and will not walk in the light of the word of God, the Lord fills them with drunkenneſs, and leaves them to daſh upon one another, and deſtroy one another like drunken men fighting in the dark. But neither words nor rods will be rightly underſtood or laid to heart, till the Spirit be poured from on high. If the Lord would pour out his Spirit, we would not only be brought to ſee our ſins, but to be aſhamed of them, to take ſhame and confuſion of face to our ſelves; we would ſorrow and mourn, and lament af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lord; we would turn from our ſins to the Lord, and joyn our ſelves to the Lord, and we would joyn together in ſeeking the Lord in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; then the Wilderneſs would be a fruitful field, the dead and ſcattered bones would be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together and live; then <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> would be one ſtick in the hand of the Lord, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. Then <hi>the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>and</hi> Judah <hi>would come together, going, and weeping, ſeeking the Lord their God, asking
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:40126:329"/> the way to</hi> Sion <hi>with their faces thitherward, ſaying, Come and let us joyn our ſelves unto the Lord in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Covenant that ſhall not be forgotten, Jer.</hi> 50.4, 5. When the Spirit is poured out from on high up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his people, then the Lord turns to them a pure Language, that they may call upon the Name of the Lord, to ſerve him with one conſent; then they turn humble Suplicants, and pour out their hearts in groans and ſighs that cannot be uttered; then Pride and Haughtineſs is taken away, and people become poor in Spirit, and have no confidence in the fleſh, but truſt in the Lord, and rejoyce in the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26, 27. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. Till the Lord come, till he return with mercy and loving-kindneſs, and turn us again, and cauſe his face to ſhine, and ſee our ways, and heal us, we will but wax worſe and worſe; there is no remedy for us, but in his Sovereign Gracc, and thoſe mercies that have been of old, and endure for ever. Let us look to him who is exalted to give Repentance to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins; that he would turn us, that we may be turned, and heal our backſlidings, and heal our breaches, that he may utter that quickning word, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.9. Come from the four winds, O breath, and breath upon theſe ſlain, that they may live; O Lord come, and overcome our evil with thy goodneſs; for who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and paſſes by the tranſgreſſion of the Remnant of thy heritage, and retains not anger for ever; becauſe thou delights in mercy, who will turn again, and will have compaſſion upon us; he will ſubdue our iniquities, and thou wilt caſt all their ſins in the depth of the Sea; thou wilt perform the truth to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the mercy to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which thou haſt ſworn to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:40126:329"/> from the days of old, <hi>Micha</hi> 7.18, 19, 20. We have not remembred our Covenant, but have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken words falſly, in making a Covenant. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, O Lord, remember thy Covenant, and eſtabliſh to us an everlaſting Covenant, that we may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our ways, and be aſhamed. Eſtabliſh thy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with us, that we may know that thou art the Lord, that we may remember and be confounded, and never open our mouth any more, becauſe of our ſhame, when thou art pacified toward us for all that we have done. O Lord, Righteouſneſs belongs to thee, but unto us confuſion of faces, as it is this day to all of us; to our Kings, Princes, Fathers, Miniſters, people of all ranks, belongs Confuſion; but to the Lord our God belongs mercies and forgiveneſs, tho' we have ſinned againſt him. Lord, give us Repentance, and turn us, and we ſhall be turned. Let thy power be great, according as thou haſt ſpoken, ſaying, <hi>The Lord is long-ſuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and tranſgreſſion.</hi> Lord, humble our uncircumciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hearts, that we may take with our ſins, and accept of the puniſhment of them, that we may remember them with ſhame and ſorrow; but do not thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member againſt us former iniquities, but according to thy mercy remember us, for thy goodneſs ſake. O Lord, remember for us thy Covenant, and repent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the multitude of thy mercies, and for thy names-ſake pardon our iniquities, for they are many and great. And when Wiſdom, and Council, and Strength, when Light and Life is gone, and when U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is gone, when there is none to help, and none of the Sons of <hi>Zion</hi> to take her by the hand in her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, when there is none to make up the breach, no Interceſſor, let thine own arm bring ſalvation.
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:40126:330"/> When all earthly Glory is ſtained, blaſted and gone, appear in thine own Glory, in the glory of thy wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, power, and Sovereign grace, in building <hi>Sion,</hi> build the houſe, and bear the glory; that when thou haſt done the work by thy Spirit, grace, grace may be glorified, and that this may be written for the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations to come, that the people which ſhall be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, may praiſe the Lord. We do not preſent our Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications before thee for our righteouſneſs, for we are all as an unclean thing, and our righteouſneſs as fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy rags; but for thy great mercy, O Lord, hear, O Lord forgive, O Lord hearken, and do; defer not for thy own ſake, O our God! for this people are called by thy Name. O Lord, the hope of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Savior thereof in the time of trouble, though our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities teſtifie againſt us do for thy name ſake, if thou mark our iniquity, we cannot ſtand, but there is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs with thee, that thou may be feared; there is mercy with thee, and plenteous redemption; and thou redeemeſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> from all his iniquities and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. O remember not againſt us former iniquities; let thy tender mercies ſpeedily prevent us, for we are brought very low; help us, O God of our Salvation, for the Glory of thy name; and deliver, and purge away our ſins for thy name ſake, ſave this people, bleſs thy Inheritance, feed them alſo, and lift them up for ever. Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praiſe. Bleſſed be the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from everlaſting to everlaſting; and let all the people ſay <hi>Amen.</hi> Praiſe ye the Lord. Unto the King eternal, immortal, inviſible, the only wiſe God, be Honour and Glory for ever and and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
